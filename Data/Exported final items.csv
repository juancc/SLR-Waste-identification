Automatic and robust waste detection and classification is a promising and challenging problem in urban solid waste disposal. The performance of the classical detection and classification method is degraded by some factors, such as various occlusion and scale differences. To enhance the detection model robustness to occlusion and small items, we proposed a robust waste detection method based on a cascade adversarial spatial dropout detection network(Cascade ASDDN). The hard examples with occlusion in pyramid feature space are generated and used to adversarial training a detection network. Hard samples are generated by the spatial dropout module with Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping. The experiment verifies the effectiveness of our method on the 2020 Haihua AI challenge waste classification. © 2020 SPIE","2020","2022-03-17 01:34:23","2022-03-25 15:56:36","","","","","11550","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/juanca/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Projects/Sasvar/Literature Review/Articles/Proposals/2020-A robust waste detection method based on cascade adversarial spatial dropout detection network.pdf","","Q3; SASVAR; Q2; to_analize","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Manual sorting of garbage is a difficult and expensive process, which is why scientists create and study automated sorting methods that increase the efficiency of the recycling process. The plastic waste may be automatically chosen on a transmission belt for waste removal by using methods of image processing and artificial intelligence, especially deep learning, to improve the recycling process. Waste segregation techniques and procedures are applied to major groups of materials such as paper, plastic, metal, and glass. Though, the biggest challenge is separating different materials types in a group, for example, sorting different colours of glass or plastics types. The issue of plastic garbage is important due to the possibility of recycling only certain types of plastic (PET can be converted into polyester material). Therefore, we should look for ways to separate this waste. One of the opportunities is the use of deep learning and convolutional neural network. In household waste, the most problematic are plastic components, and the main types are polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene. The main problem considered in this article is creating an automatic plastic waste segregation method, which can separate garbage into four mentioned categories, PS, PP, PE-HD, and PET, and could be applicable on a sorting plant or home by citizens. We proposed a technique that can apply in portable devices for waste recognizing which would be helpful in solving urban waste problems. © 2021 Janusz Bobulski and Mariusz Kubanek.","2021","2022-03-17 01:34:16","2022-03-25 15:56:36","","","","","2021","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/juanca/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Projects/Sasvar/Literature Review/Articles/Proposals/2021-Deep Learning for Plastic Waste Classification System.pdf","","Q3; SASVAR; Q2; to_analize","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most of the current methods only use a single modality such as image data or acoustic data for waste classification, which makes it difficult to classify mixed and confusable wastes. In these complex situations, using multiple modalities becomes necessary to achieve a high classification accuracy. Traditionally, the fusion of multiple modalities has been limited by fixed handcrafted features. In this study, the deep-learning approach was applied to the multimodal fusion at the feature level for municipal solid-waste sorting. More specifically, the pre-trained VGG16 and one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNNs) were utilized to extract features from visual data and acoustic data, respectively. These deeply learned features were then fused in the fully connected layers for classification. The results of comparative experiments proved that the proposed method was superior to the single-modality methods.

In this paper, a novel ensemble learning model called EnCNN-UPMWS, which is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and an unequal precision measurement weighting strategy (UPMWS), is proposed for the classification of HSW via waste images. First, three state-of-the-art CNNs, namely GoogLeNet, ResNet-50, and MobileNetV2, are used as ingredient classifiers to separately predict and obtain three predicted probability vectors, which are significant elements that affect the prediction performance by providing complementary information about the patterns to be classified. Then, the UPMWS is introduced to determine the weight coefficients of the ensemble models. The actual one-hot encoding labels of the validation set and the predicted probability vectors from the CNN ensemble are creatively used to calculate the weights for each classifier during the training phase, which can bring the aggregated prediction vector closer to the target label and improve the performance of the ensemble model. The proposed model was applied to two datasets, namely TrashNet (an open-access dataset) and FourTrash, which was constructed by collecting a total of 47,332 common HSW images containing four types of waste (wet waste, recyclables, harmful waste, and dry waste). The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of its accuracy and F1-scores. Moreover, it was found that the UPMWS can simply and effectively enhance the performance of the ensemble learning model, and has potential applications in similar tasks of classification via ensemble learning. © 2021 by the authors.

In order to obtain an accurate and fast CNN architecture, several types of Single Shot Detectors (SSD) and Regional Proposal Networks (RPN) have been fine-tuned on the TrashNet database. The network with the best performances is executed on one autonomous robot system, which is able to collect detected waste from the ground based on the CNN feedback. For this type of application, a precise identification of municipal waste objects is very important. In order to develop a straightforward pipeline for waste detection, the paper focuses on boosting the performance of pre-trained CNN Object Detectors, in terms of precision, generalization, and detection speed, using different loss optimization methods, database augmentation, and asynchronous threading at inference time. The pipeline consists of data augmentation at the training time followed by CNN feature extraction and box predictor modules for localization and classification at different feature map sizes. The trained model is generated for inference afterwards. The experiments revealed better performances than all other Object Detectors trained on TrashNet or other garbage datasets with a precision of 97.63% accuracy for SSD and 95.76% accuracy for Faster R-CNN, respectively. In order to find the optimal higher and lower bounds of our learning rate where the network is actually learning, we trained our model for several epochs, updating the learning rate after each epoch, starting from 1 × 10−10 and decreasing it until reaching 1 × 10−1. © 2020 by the authors.

The understandings obtained from the data can assist municipal authorities handle assets and services effectually. At the same time, the massive increase in environmental pollution and degradation leads to ecological imbalance is a hot research topic. Besides, the progressive development of smart cities over the globe requires the design of intelligent waste management systems to properly categorize the waste depending upon the nature of biodegradability. Few of the commonly available wastes are paper, paper boxes, food, glass, etc. In order to classify the waste objects, computer vision based solutions are cost effective to separate out the waste from the huge dump of garbage and trash. Due to the recent developments of deep learning (DL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL), waste object classification becomes possible by the identification and detection of wastes. In this aspect, this paper designs an intelligence DRL based recycling waste object detection and classification (IDRL-RWODC) model for smart cities. The goal of the IDRL-RWODC technique is to detect and classify waste objects using the DL and DRL techniques. The IDRL-RWODC technique encompasses a two-stage process namely Mask Regional Convolutional Neural Network (Mask RCNN) based object detection and DRL based object classification. In addition, DenseNet model is applied as a baseline model for the Mask RCNN model, and a deep Q-learning network (DQLN) is employed as a classifier.Moreover, a dragonfly algorithm (DFA) based hyperparameter optimizer is derived for improving the efficiency of the DenseNet model.

Recovery of recyclables is usually performed by waste pickers, which is highly risky and hazardous for their health. This paper reports the development of a robotic mobile manipulation system for automated sorting of useful recyclables from MSW. The developed robot is equipped with a thermal imaging camera, proximity sensor and a 5-DOF robotic arm. This paper presents an approach for sorting based on automated identification from thermographic images. The developed algorithm extracts keypoint features from the thermographic image and feeds into clustering model to map them into a bag-of-word vectors. Finally, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used for identifying the recyclable material. We used the developed algorithm to detect three categories of recyclables namely, aluminum can, plastic bottle and tetra pack from given thermographic images. We obtained classification rate of 94.3% in the tests. In future, we plan to extend the developed approach for classifying a wider range of recyclable objects as well as to incorporate motion planning algorithms to handle cluttered environments.

For this purpose, an experimental setup equipped with a sound recording mechanism was prepared. Packaging waste sounds generated by three physical impacts such as free falling, pneumatic hitting and hydraulic crushing were separately recorded using two different microphones. To classify the waste types and sizes based on sound features of the wastes, a support vector machine (SVM) and a hidden Markov model (HMM) based sound classification systems were developed. In the basic experimental setup in which only free falling impact type was considered, SVM and HMM systems provided 100% classification accuracy for both microphones. In the expanded experimental setup which includes all three impact types, material type classification accuracies were 96.5% for dynamic microphone and 97.7% for condenser microphone. When both the material type and the size of the wastes were classified, the accuracy was 88.6% for the microphones. The modeling studies indicated that hydraulic crushing impact type recordings were very noisy for an effective sound recognition application. In the detailed analysis of the recognition errors, it was observed that most of the errors occurred in the hitting impact type. According to the experimental results, it can be said that the proposed novel approach for the separation of packaging wastes could provide a high classification performance for RVMs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","2016","2022-03-17 01:34:19","2022-03-25 15:56:23","","46-52","","","56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/juanca/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Projects/Sasvar/Literature Review/Articles/Proposals/2016-An investigation of the usability of sound recognition for source separation of packaging wastes in reverse vending machines.pdf","","Q3; SASVAR; Q1; Q2; to_analize","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Indeed, the optimal classification method should be able, in a reasonable time, to maximise the separation between the classes of interest and, at the same time, to correctly reject possible outlier samples. To this aim, a new extension of Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), namely Soft PLS-DA, has been implemented. The basic engine of Soft PLS-DA is the same as PLS-DA, but class assignment is subjected to some additional criteria which allow samples not belonging to the target classes to be identified and rejected. The proposed approach was tested on a real case study of plastic waste sorting based on near infrared hyperspectral imaging. Household plastic waste objects made of the six recyclable plastic polymers commonly used for packaging were collected and imaged using a hyperspectral camera mounted on an industrial sorting system. In addition, paper and not recyclable plastics were also considered as potential foreign materials that are commonly found in plastic waste. For classification purposes, the Soft PLS-DA algorithm was integrated into a hierarchical classification tree for the discrimination of the different plastic polymers. Furthermore, Soft PLS-DA was also coupled with sparse-based variable selection to identify the relevant variables involved in the classification and to speed up the sorting process. The tree-structured classification model was successfully validated both on a test set of representative spectra of each material for a quantitative evaluation, and at the pixel level on a set of hyperspectral images for a qualitative assessment. © 2018 The Authors.","2018","2022-03-17 01:34:18","2022-03-25 15:56:36","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/juanca/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Projects/Sasvar/Literature Review/Articles/Proposals/2018-Developmentof a classification algorithm for efficient handling of multiple classes in sorting systems based on hyperspectral imaging.pdf","","Q3; SASVAR; Q2; to_analize","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prerequisite for this is the derivation of mass-based material flow characteristics from pixel-based sensor data, which requires known individual particle masses. Since particle masses cannot be measured inline, the prediction of particle masses of lightweight packaging (LWP) waste using machine learning (ML) algorithms is investigated. Five LWP material classes were sampled, preprocessed, and scanned on a custom-made test rig, resulting in a dataset containing 3D laser triangulation (3DLT) images, RGB images, and corresponding masses of n = 3,830 particles. Based on 66 extracted shape measurements, six ML models were trained for particle mass prediction (PMP). Their performance was compared with two state-of-the-art reference models using (i) material-specific mean particle masses and (ii) grammages. Obtained particle masses showed a high variation and significant differences between material classes and particle size classes. After feature selection, both reference models achieving R2-scores of (i) 0.422 ± 0.121 and (ii) 0.533 ± 0.224 were outperformed by all investigated ML models. A random forest regressor with an R2-score of 0.763 ± 0.091 and a normalized mean absolute error of 0.243 ± 0.050 achieved the most accurate PMP. In contrast to studies on primary raw materials, PMP of LWP waste is challenging due to influences of packaging design and post-consumer disposal behavior. ML algorithms are a promising approach for PMP that outperform state-of-the-art methods by 43% higher R2-scores. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2022-03-17 01:34:20","2022-03-25 15:56:23","","253-265","","","136","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/juanca/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Projects/Sasvar/Literature Review/Articles/Proposals/2021-Sensor-based particle mass prediction of lightweight packaging waste using machine learning algorithms.pdf","","Q3; SASVAR; Q1; to_analize","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to get a metal from Earth, the process called mining are needed where it can harm our natural resources due to depletion of the area to be mined. If the process is not controlled, most of the areas on Earth will have huge excavation holes. So, people should be responsible to prevent this from happening to preserve the environment in a good quality by recycling the metal material. By metal recycling, it can save an energy and resources as it can reduce the demand for raw materials, hence maintain the natural resources for the future. The proposed automatic metal waste separation system is intended to ease the people to separate the waste material. Besides, it will make the metal recycling industry work easier because the metal waste is already isolated at garbage collection side. The purpose of the project is to design a system to separate the metal recyclable household waste automatically and record the data waste collected. There are total of four detectors used to separate the non-metal, steel, copper and aluminum metal waste. The average time used to complete metal separation process by using the proposed prototype is 14.5 seconds. This project includes a mechanical part, programming part and an electronic design. The system will be programmed using Arduino Mega as a microcontroller to control all the electronic component in the system.","2018","2022-03-17 01:34:19","2022-03-25 15:56:23","","366-371","","","","","","","","","","","Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Fac Engn, Dept Elect & Comp Engn; IEEE Instrumentat & Measurement Soc, Malaysia Chapter","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/juanca/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Projects/Sasvar/Literature Review/Articles/Proposals/2018-Automatic Metal waste separator system in Malaysia.pdf","","SASVAR; Q1; to_analize","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is estimated that in 2006 the total amount of municipal solid waste generated globally reached 2.02 billion tones, representing a 7% annual increase since 2003 (Global Waste Management Market Report 2007). The segregation, handling, transport, and disposal of waste needs to be properly managed to minimize the risk to the health and safety of patients, the public, and the environment. The economic value of waste is best realized when it is segregated. Currently, there is no such system of segregation of dry, wet and metallic wastes at the household level. This paper proposes an Automated Waste Segregator (AWS) which is a cheap, easy to use solution for a segregation system for household use, so that it can be sent directly for processing. It is designed to sort the refuse into metallic waste, wet waste and dry waste. The AWS employs parallel resonant impedance sensing mechanism to identify metallic items, and capacitive sensors to distinguish between wet and dry waste. Experimental results show that the segregation of waste into metallic, wet and dry waste has been successfully implemented using the AWS. © 2014 IEEE.","2017","2022-03-17 01:34:19","2022-03-25 15:56:23","","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/juanca/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Projects/Sasvar/Literature Review/Articles/Proposals/2017-Automated Waste Segregator.pdf","","SASVAR; Q1; to_analize","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the classical city problems is the habits of its people who do not care about cleanliness of their environment. Awareness of how to throw and manage garbage in a good manner is still not become an important consideration. The government doesn't have yet the efficient waste management system. Waste management system based on information technology capable of handling waste management problems is needed to overcome this problems. In this work, a prototype of waste management system has been developed, especially for the solid waste, focusing on segregation and garbage collection phase. The system consists of three main subsystems: the hardware subsystem consist of trash bin equipped with sensors and communication system for monitoring the garbage status and controlling the garbage collection schedule. The other subsystems are data management and data visualization subsystem for management and analysis purposes. The prototype was built and tested. It shows that the system can operate well, their sensors can detect different type of garbage, also can send and display the garbage status to the management display station. The prototype can meet the needs that have been defined as part of urban waste management solution. © 2018 IEEE.","2018","2022-03-17 01:34:18","2022-03-25 15:56:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/juanca/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Projects/Sasvar/Literature Review/Articles/Proposals/2018-Design and Development of Smart Trash Bin Prototype for Municipal Solid Waste Management.pdf","","SASVAR; Q1; to_analize","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, despite the efforts done by the government and local authorities on promoting recycling culture by introducing new laws and regulations, the awareness and willingness among the community is still low. One of the possible reasons to this is lack of effort to categorize the waste into the designated category which are paper, glass, plastic and metal. In order to address this problem, it is important to design a system that will ease the process of categorizing the waste. This can be achieve by the automation of the said process. In this work, a system consist of an algorithm and hardware to automatically categorize recyclable waste is proposed. The proposed system are utilizing weight sensor and ultrasonic sensors in order to capture the characteristics of the waste item, which are weight and size so that it can be categorized into paper, glass, plastic and metal.

However, their increased use has increased the global proportion of plastic wastes, which creates a serious environmental issue, thereby, creating a demand for plastic waste management techniques. Improving the efficiency of resource recovery by appropriate sorting and collection systems is necessary for successful plastic recycling. Therefore, this study proposed a three-step optimization process of a reverse vending machine (RVM), a small automatic recyclable waste sorter/collector system, for acquiring an optimal design and enhanced efficiency. The RVM system categorized recyclable wastes as plastics, glass, and cans using barcode, vision, and near infrared sensors. The average sorting efficiency of the designed RVM system was 94%, 95% for polyethylene terephthalate, and 98% for glass bottles. Therefore, the RVM system, with the average sorting efficiency of 95%, is suitable for application in on-site sorting in small-sized areas, such as convenience stores, which generate wastes on a small scale.

However, most current studies have focused exclusively on single-label waste classification from images, which goes against common sense. In this paper, we move beyond single-label waste classification and propose a benchmark for evaluating the multi-label waste classification and localization tasks to advance waste management via deep learning-based methods. We propose a multi-task learning architecture (MTLA) based on a convolutional neural network, which can be used to simultaneously identify and locate wastes in images. The MTLA comprises a backbone network with proposed attention modules, a novel multi-level feature pyramid network, and a group of joint learning multi-task subnets. To achieve joint optimization of waste identification and location, we designed the loss functions according to the concepts of focusing and joint. The proposed MTLA achieved performance similar to that of experts and had high scores for multiple tasks related to waste management. Its F1 score exceeded 95.50% (95.12% to 95.88%, with a 95% confidence interval) on the multi-label waste classification task, and the average precision score was over 81.50% (@IoU = 0.5) on the waste localization task. To improve interpretation, heatmaps were used to visualize the salient features extracted by the MTLA. The proposed MTLA is a promising auxiliary tool that can improve the automation of waste management systems.","2021","2022-03-24 15:58:20","2022-03-25 15:56:36","","247-257","","","126","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/juanca/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Projects/Sasvar/Literature Review/Articles/Proposals/2021- A deep convolutional neural network to simultaneously localize and recognize waste types in images.pdf","","Q3; SASVAR; Q2; to_analize","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
