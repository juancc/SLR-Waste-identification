abstract={Accurate and efficient treatment of domestic waste is an important part of urban management. Whether domestic waste can be classified effectively will affect the sustainable development of human society. Previous research on the problem of waste image classification has focused on single-category waste recognition, which falls short of meeting the needs of real waste classification scenarios. In this study, a YOLO-WASTE multi-label waste classification model based on transfer learning is constructed to realize the fast recognition and classification of multiple wastes. To speed up and optimize the learning efficiency of the model, a multi-label waste image dataset is also created, with each image including multiple wastes or multiple categories of waste. The experimental result shows that the mAP value of the YOLO-WASTE model is 92.23%, and the average time of detecting an image is 0.424 s, its classification performance is significantly better than other image classification algorithms. The proposed YOLO-WASTE model provides new insights into complex waste identification and has the potential to help advance efficient waste management for sustainable urban development. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Waste sorting is highly labor intensive because the wide variety of waste items prohibits automation. More recently, deep learning (DL) and computer vision technology has presented an opportunity to streamline the sorting process, but many important developmental steps remain. If computer vision technology can increase the efficiency of automated waste sorting, this would be beneficial for society and the environment. Accordingly, this study used the You Only Look Once-v3 (Yolo-v3) detection model based on DL to enhance recognition performance of household waste products. TrashNet, a commonly used waste image database, was used to train an initial Yolo-v3 model, however each image used for training only had a single waste object, and this study found that the detection model trained with a single object dataset was not only unsuitable for sorting multiple waste objects, but that this has rarely been addressed in academic literature. It was also discovered that nations and regions will need to develop their own unique databases that reflect the types of waste products found. Samples images need to account for the various appearances and colors and be combined in multiple waste object images when training the system. This paper documents the training and testing of an object detection model suitable for detecting domestic waste specific to Taiwan; however, the approach taken would be of use to other countries seeking to automate waste sorting. To achieve this, it was necessary to compile the Taiwan Recycled Waste Database (TRWD). This was then used to train the Yolo-v3, and the efficiencies of this, versus the standard TrashNet model were compared. Results showed that the TRWD-trained Yolo-v3 achieved mAP@0.5 of 92.12% and could detect waste in real-time. Relative to the TrashNet-trained Yolo-v3, the TRWD counterpart performed better due to the multiple waste objects and more relevant image repository. Further studies are recommended to investigate the effect of combining additional sensors that would enable improved detection of specific wastes. Combining the TRWD-trained Yolo-v3 with a robot system for waste sorting would potentially be another rewarding avenue of research. © 2022},

abstract={Waste sorting is highly recommended for municipal solid waste (MSW) management. Increasingly, computer vision (CV), robotics, and other smart technologies are used for MSW sorting. Particularly, the field of CV-enabled waste sorting is experiencing an unprecedented explosion of academic research. However, little attention has been paid to understanding its evolvement path, status quo, and prospects and challenges ahead. To address the knowledge gap, this paper provides a critical review of academic research that focuses on CV-enabled MSW sorting. Prevalent CV algorithms, in particular their technical rationales and prediction performance, are introduced and compared. The distribution of academic research outputs is also examined from the aspects of waste sources, task objectives, application domains, and dataset accessibility. The review discovers a trend of shifting from traditional machine learning to deep learning algorithms. The robustness of CV for waste sorting is increasingly enhanced owing to the improved computation powers and algorithms. Academic studies were unevenly distributed in different sectors such as household, commerce and institution, and construction. Too often, researchers reported some preliminary studies using simplified environments and artificially collected data. Future research efforts are encouraged to consider the complexities of real-world scenarios and implement CV in industrial waste sorting practice. This paper also calls for open sharing of waste image datasets for interested researchers to train and evaluate their CV algorithms. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Garbage classification technology is not only an important basis for the harmless treatment of waste and resource recovery, but also the inevitable trend of social development. The current garbage classification methods rely on manual classification in the garbage collection stage, and it is difficult to achieve satisfying results in consistency, stability, and sanitary conditions. For this reason, this study designs and develops a garbage classification system based on deep learning that can recognize and recycle domestic garbage. Focusing on the problems of low accuracy and poor real-time performance, a lightweight garbage classification model GCNet (Garbage Classification Network) is proposed. GCNet contains three improvements on ShuffleNet v2, including the design of parallel mixed attention mechanism (PMAM), the use of new activation functions, and transfer learning. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of GCNet on the self-built dataset is 97.9%, the amount of model parameters is only 1.3M, the single inference time on Raspberry Pi 4B is about 105ms, and the classification system needs only 0.88 seconds to complete the classification and collection of a single object. The method proposed in this paper is an effective attempt at machine vision in garbage classification and resource recovery. With the improvement of technology, it will effectively promote academic exploration and engineering application in the field of resources and environment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In recent years, the production of municipal solid waste has constantly been increasing. Recycling is becoming more and more important, as it is the only way that we can have a clean and sustainable environment. Recycling, however, is a process that is not fully automated; large volumes of waste materials need to be processed manually. New and novel techniques have to be implemented in order to manage the increased volume of waste materials at recycling factories. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology that can identify common waste materials as they are being processed on a moving belt in waste collection facilities. An efficient waste material detection and classification system is proposed, which can be used in real integrated solid waste management systems. This system is based on a convolutional neural network and is trained using a custom dataset of images, taken on site from actual moving belts in waste collection facilities. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system can outperform existing algorithms found in the literature in real-world conditions, with 92.43% accuracy. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Nowadays, problems related with solid waste management become a challenge for most countries due to the rising generation of waste, related environmental issues, and associated costs of produced wastes. Effective waste management systems at different geographic levels require accurate forecasting of future waste generation. In this work, we investigate how open-access data, such as provided from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), can be used for the analysis of waste data. The main idea of this study is finding the links between socioeconomic and demographic variables that determine the amounts of types of solid wastes produced by countries. This would make it possible to accurately predict at the country level the waste production and determine the requirements for the development of effective waste management strategies. In particular, we use several machine learning data regression (Support Vector, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest) and clustering models (k-means) to respectively predict waste production for OECD countries along years and also to perform clustering among these countries according to similar characteristics. The main contributions of our work are: (1) waste analysis at the OECD country-level to compare and cluster countries according to similar waste features predicted; (2) the detection of most relevant features for prediction models; and (3) the comparison between several regression models with respect to accuracy in predictions. Coefficient of determination (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), respectively, are used as indices of the efficiency of the developed models. Our experiments have shown that some data pre-processings on the OECD data are an essential stage required in the analysis; that Random Forest Regressor (RFR) produced the best prediction results over the dataset; and that these results are highly influenced by the quality of available socio-economic data. In particular, the RFR model exhibited the highest accuracy in predictions for most waste types. For example, for “municipal” waste, it produced, respectively, R2 = 1 and MAPE = 4.31 global error values for the test set; and for “household” waste, it, respectively, produced R2 = 1 and MAPE = 3.03. Our results indicate that the considered models (and specially RFR) all are effective in predicting the amount of produced wastes derived from input data for the considered countries. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={The Smart City concept revolves around gathering real time data from citizen, personal vehicle, public transports, building, and other urban infrastructures like power grid and waste disposal system. The understandings obtained from the data can assist municipal authorities handle assets and services effectually. At the same time, the massive increase in environmental pollution and degradation leads to ecological imbalance is a hot research topic. Besides, the progressive development of smart cities over the globe requires the design of intelligent waste management systems to properly categorize the waste depending upon the nature of biodegradability. Few of the commonly available wastes are paper, paper boxes, food, glass, etc. In order to classify the waste objects, computer vision based solutions are cost effective to separate out the waste from the huge dump of garbage and trash. Due to the recent developments of deep learning (DL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL), waste object classification becomes possible by the identification and detection of wastes. In this aspect, this paper designs an intelligence DRL based recycling waste object detection and classification (IDRL-RWODC) model for smart cities. The goal of the IDRL-RWODC technique is to detect and classify waste objects using the DL and DRL techniques. The IDRL-RWODC technique encompasses a two-stage process namely Mask Regional Convolutional Neural Network (Mask RCNN) based object detection and DRL based object classification. In addition, DenseNet model is applied as a baseline model for the Mask RCNN model, and a deep Q-learning network (DQLN) is employed as a classifier.Moreover, a dragonfly algorithm (DFA) based hyperparameter optimizer is derived for improving the efficiency of the DenseNet model. In order to ensure the enhanced waste classification performance of the IDRL-RWODC technique, a series of simulations take place on benchmark dataset and the experimental results pointed out the better performance over the recent techniques with maximal accuracy of 0.993. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

abstract={Only 4% of household waste generated in Africa is recycled. Current research uses machine learning models in cloud-based solutions to classify waste. However, in countries with limited internet access, there is a need to increase user engagement in classifying waste using an on-device approach. Developing a machine learning model for a mobile device with limited size and speed is a challenge. This research proposes an on-device deep learning framework to encourage the recycling of household waste. The proposed framework combines an optimal deep learning image classification model and gamification elements. A combination of multiple waste datasets named WasteNet consisting of 33,520 images is used to train the deep learning image classification model using seven classes of recyclable waste namely e-waste, garbage, glass, metal, organic, paper and plastic. Data augmentation and transfer learning techniques are applied to train five models on a mobile device namely, MobileNetV2, VGG19, DenseNet201, ResNet152V2 and InceptionResNetV2. Results of the five models are presented in this paper based on accuracy, loss, latency and size. This research shows promise for InceptionResNetV2, MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201in encouraging householders to engage in recycling waste using gamification on a mobile device. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Domestic waste classification was incorporated into legal provisions recently in China. However, relying on manpower to detect and classify domestic waste is highly inefficient. To that end, in this article, we propose a multimodel cascaded convolutional neural network (MCCNN) for domestic waste image detection and classification. MCCNN combined three subnetworks (DSSD, YOLOv4, and Faster-RCNN) to obtain the detections. Moreover, to suppress the false-positive predicts, we utilized a classification model cascaded with the detection part to judge whether the detection results are correct. To train and evaluate MCCNN, we designed a large-scale waste image dataset (LSWID), containing 30 000 domestic waste multilabeled images with 52 categories. To the best of our knowledge, the LSWID is the largest dataset on domestic waste images. Furthermore, a smart trash can is designed and applied to a Shanghai community, which helped to make waste recycling more efficient. Experimental results showed a state-of-the-art performance, with an average improvement of 10% in detection precision. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Sensor-based material flow characterization (SBMC) promises to improve the performance of future-generation sorting plants by enabling new applications like automatic quality monitoring or process control. Prerequisite for this is the derivation of mass-based material flow characteristics from pixel-based sensor data, which requires known individual particle masses. Since particle masses cannot be measured inline, the prediction of particle masses of lightweight packaging (LWP) waste using machine learning (ML) algorithms is investigated. Five LWP material classes were sampled, preprocessed, and scanned on a custom-made test rig, resulting in a dataset containing 3D laser triangulation (3DLT) images, RGB images, and corresponding masses of n = 3,830 particles. Based on 66 extracted shape measurements, six ML models were trained for particle mass prediction (PMP). Their performance was compared with two state-of-the-art reference models using (i) material-specific mean particle masses and (ii) grammages. Obtained particle masses showed a high variation and significant differences between material classes and particle size classes. After feature selection, both reference models achieving R2-scores of (i) 0.422 ± 0.121 and (ii) 0.533 ± 0.224 were outperformed by all investigated ML models. A random forest regressor with an R2-score of 0.763 ± 0.091 and a normalized mean absolute error of 0.243 ± 0.050 achieved the most accurate PMP. In contrast to studies on primary raw materials, PMP of LWP waste is challenging due to influences of packaging design and post-consumer disposal behavior. ML algorithms are a promising approach for PMP that outperform state-of-the-art methods by 43% higher R2-scores. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The total waste generation in India reported for 2015 is highly uncertain (51–300 Tgy−1), primarily because observational data from rural regions within India is lacking. This makes it difficult to constrain rural waste generation rates. Official government data (51 Tg) denies the existence of rural waste generation in India. The rural data gap makes it difficult to construct accurate open waste burning emission inventories and plan waste management infrastructure. Our study presents activity data from understudied rural regions across India and establishes a relationship between waste generation and household income for both urban and rural India. We use this relationship to create a 0.1° x 0.1° gridded waste generation and waste treatment dataset and construct an open waste burning emission inventory for India (OWBEII) for the year 2020, after segregating both the rural and urban population into 5 income group with the help of socioeconomic data from the national health surveys. We find that out of 192 (102−231) Tgy−1 waste generated in 2020, 74 (30–92) Tgy−1 was burned in the open. Open waste burning is a widely established practice of waste disposal in developing nations and emits particulate matter (285–1401 Ggy−1 PM2.5 and 322–1486 Ggy−1 PM10), a suite of carcinogens (19–82 Ggy−1 benzene) and very reactive VOCs, which act as precursors to tropospheric ozone and secondary aerosol formation. The anthropogenic emissions of formaldehyde (a Group 1 carcinogen) from this source are 5.7 times larger than India's currently recognized total anthropogenic budget of formaldehyde in the EDGARv4.3.2 emission inventory. © 2021},

The municipalities are responsible for the implementation of the waste policy in a common regional framework and, interestingly, they have to make decisions regarding the price level, the pricing unit, and the waste streams collected at the curbside. Using a fixed effects panel two-step GMM, we show that curbside collection of organic waste reduces residual waste but also reduces the household sensitivity to prices. We also find that the weight-based pricing system has a significant impact on the reduction of residual waste, an effect that is increasing in the long-run, on the improvement of sorting and on the effectiveness of the price instruments. © Presses de Sciences Po.

abstract={The rapid economic and social development has led to a rapid increase in the output of domestic waste. How to realize waste classification through intelligent methods has become a key factor for human beings to achieve sustainable development. Traditional waste classification technology has low efficiency and low accuracy. To improve the efficiency and accuracy of waste classification processing, this paper proposes a DenseNet169 waste image classification model based on transfer learning. Because of the disadvantages of the existing public waste dataset, such as uneven distribution of data, single background, obvious features, and small sample size of the waste image, the waste image dataset NWNU-TRASH is constructed. The dataset has the advantages of balanced distribution, high diversity, and rich background, which is more in line with real needs. 70% of the dataset is used as the training set and 30% as the test set. Based on the deep learning network DenseNet169 pre-trained model, we can form a DenseNet169 model suitable for this experimental dataset. The experimental results show that the accuracy of classification is over 82% in the DenseNet169 model after the transfer learning, which is better than other image classification algorithms. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) play an irreplaceable role in eliminating pollutants from domestic and industrial wastewater and contribute to water recycling. Nowadays, the selection of processes configuration of WWTPs mainly depends on the local wastewater treatment standards and the experience of wastewater engineers rather than an intelligent data-driven strategy. In this study, an integrated data-driven strategy consisting of t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and deep neural networks (DNNs) is proposed for optimizing the processes configuration of full-scale WWTP predesign. A large dataset with 14,647 samples collected from 10 full-scale WWTPs with distinct treatment processes is clustered by the t-SNE method based on the influent characteristics, and four meaningful clusters (Clusters I–IV) are identified for the subsequent development of DNN classification models. All four DNN models achieve acceptable classification accuracy (>0.8975) and the maximal testing accuracy is 0.9505. The DNN models are capable of finding the optimized processes configuration of WWTPs under target scenarios. Our results highlight the strength of combining the t-SNE and the DNN models to utilize the relationships between key parameters and processes configuration of WWTPs, and help engineers predesign WWTPs with the optimal processes configuration. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Automatically identifying the degradability of municipal solid waste (MSW) is one of the key prerequisites for on-site composting to prevent contaminations from undegradable wastes. In this study, a cost-effective method was proposed for the degradability identification of MSW. Firstly, the trainable images in the datasets were increased by performing four different sizes of cropping operations on the original images captured on-site. Secondly, a lite convolutional neural network (CNN) model was built with only 3.37 million parameters, and then a total of eight models were trained on these datasets with and without the image augmentation operations, respectively. Finally, a degradability identification system was built for on-site composting, where the images were cut to different sizes of small squares for prediction, and the experiments were conducted to find the best combinations of the trained models and the cutting size. The results showed that the validation accuracies of the models trained with the augmentation operations were 0.91-2.07 percentage points higher, and in the evaluation of the degradability identification system the best result was achieved by the combination of W8A dataset and cutting size of 1/14 reached an accuracy of 91.58%, which indicated the capability of this cost-effective method to identify the degradability of MSW. © 2021, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Our analysis aims at detecting the extent to which actual behavior in (close-by) municipalities is similar with respect to those two aspects. To pursue our scope, a complex network approach is followed. In particular, we conceptualize, explore and compare two networks, whose nodes are the municipalities, while weights synthesize in one network the percentage of sorted waste that is collected at a municipal level, and in the other one the distance from the waste processing plants used by each municipality. The theoretical network models are implemented through an empirical study based on a high quality dataset referred to Italian municipalities. In this regard, the detection of communities of municipalities and their geospatial contextualization are introduced as devices for a complete description of current practices of municipal waste separation and transfers in Italy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The accurate and effective classification of household solid waste (HSW) is an indispensable component in the current procedure of waste disposal. In this paper, a novel ensemble learning model called EnCNN-UPMWS, which is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and an unequal precision measurement weighting strategy (UPMWS), is proposed for the classification of HSW via waste images. First, three state-of-the-art CNNs, namely GoogLeNet, ResNet-50, and MobileNetV2, are used as ingredient classifiers to separately predict and obtain three predicted probability vectors, which are significant elements that affect the prediction performance by providing complementary information about the patterns to be classified. Then, the UPMWS is introduced to determine the weight coefficients of the ensemble models. The actual one-hot encoding labels of the validation set and the predicted probability vectors from the CNN ensemble are creatively used to calculate the weights for each classifier during the training phase, which can bring the aggregated prediction vector closer to the target label and improve the performance of the ensemble model. The proposed model was applied to two datasets, namely TrashNet (an open-access dataset) and FourTrash, which was constructed by collecting a total of 47,332 common HSW images containing four types of waste (wet waste, recyclables, harmful waste, and dry waste). The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of its accuracy and F1-scores. Moreover, it was found that the UPMWS can simply and effectively enhance the performance of the ensemble learning model, and has potential applications in similar tasks of classification via ensemble learning. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Wastewaters serve as important hot spots for antimicrobial resistance and monitoring can be used to analyse the abundance and diversity of antimicrobial resistance genes at the level of large bacterial and human populations. In this study, whole genome sequencing of beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and metagenomic analysis of whole-community DNA were used to characterize the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in hospital, municipal and river waters in the city of Brno (Czech Republic). Cefotaxime-resistant E. coli were mainly extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers (95.6%, n = 158), of which the majority carried blaCTX-M (98.7%; n = 151) and were detected in all water samples except the outflow from hospital wastewater treatment plant. A wide phylogenetic diversity was observed among the sequenced E. coli (n = 78) based on the detection of 40 sequence types and single nucleotide polymorphisms (average number 34,666 ± 15,710) between strains. The metagenomic analysis revealed a high occurrence of bacterial genera with potentially pathogenic members, including Pseudomonas, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Aeromonas, Enterobacter and Arcobacter (relative abundance &gt;50%) in untreated hospital and municipal wastewaters and predominance of environmental bacteria in treated and river waters. Genes encoding resistance to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, quinolones and macrolides were frequently detected, however blaCTX-M was not found in this dataset which may be affected by insufficient sequencing depth of the samples. The study pointed out municipal treated wastewater as a possible source of multi-drug resistant E. coli and antimicrobial resistance genes for surface waters. Moreover, the combination of two different approaches provided a more holistic view on antimicrobial resistance in water environments. The culture-based approach facilitated insight into the dynamics of ESBL-producing E. coli and the metagenomics shows abundance and diversity of bacteria and antimicrobial resistance genes vary across water sites. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Dioxin (DXN) is a kind of persistent organic pollutant with a cumulative effect. It is also one of the main reasons for 'not in my back yard' effect in Municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) plants. Real-time detection of DXN is helpful to realize emission reduction, optimize control, and eliminate oppose effect in MSWI process. However, there are very tiny label process data that can be used to construct data-driven prediction models due to the time and economic cost. In order to utilize the process data, this article presents a collaborative training decision trees (CTDTs) method for dioxin emission concentration prediction. First, the raw label process data is used to train the decision tree model, after that the process data is labeled. Second, the root mean square error of the labeled sample is calculated to select the optimal labeled and process data. Third, the DXN emission prediction model is constructed by cross-combination of the raw labels and labeled process data. Simulation results of the benchmark dataset and practical DXN data verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={We present a proof-of-concept method to classify the presence of glass and metal in consumer trash bags. With the prevalent utilization of waste collection trucks in municipal solid waste management, the aim of this method is to help pinpoint the locations where waste sorting quality is below accepted standards, making it possible and more efficient to develop tailored procedures that can improve the waste sorting quality in areas with the most urgent needs. Using trash bags containing various amounts of glass and metal, in addition to common waste found in households, we use a combination of sound recording and a beat-frequency oscillation metal detector as inputs to a machine learning algorithm to identify the occurrence of glass and metal in trash bags. A custom-built test rig was developed to mimic a real waste collection truck, which was used to test different sensors and build the datasets. Convolutional neural networks were trained for the classification task, achieving accuracies of up to 98%. These promising results support this method's potential implementation in real waste collection trucks, enabling location-specific and long-term monitoring of consumer waste sorting quality, which can provide decision support for waste management systems, and research on consumer behavior. © 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract={Sustainable waste management has become one of the great concerns in many countries to reduce the negative environmental and health impact caused by the increase of unmanaged household garbage. One of the key elements is waste recycling, that relies on the process of garbage sorting to separate the recycled garbage into different categories for further processing. The sorting process in waste recycling is usually done manually by hand-picking. Therefore, a system that can recognize waste automatically is needed so that the waste sorting process can be done more quickly and accurately. In this paper, we propose a waste segmentation method using Convolutional Neural Network based on the Encoder-Decoder approach of SegNet architecture [5]. We compare two different setups of the architecture based on the number of filters in each convolutional layer, then evaluate our model using TrashNet benchmark dataset. Our experiment shows that one of our proposed architecture managed to achieve 82.95% intersection over union (IoU) value, which is higher than the previous work by the TrashNet developer. © 2020 IEEE.},

This paper views the selective waste collection schemes in pilot cities of China as one typical nudging policy and empirically examines its impacts on household waste source separation. Using a novel nationally representative dataset from the Chinese General Social Survey, we find that the pilot program significantly increases the frequency of household waste sorting, which are reinforced for people with high levels of social trust or low individualism. In addition, further evidence points to that the pilot program not only increases the frequency of household waste source separation in neighboring cities but also prominently stimulates waste prevention and reduction practices in targeted people. Finally, waste-related knowledge and interpersonal interaction are likely operative channels of impacts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper presents an extensive research carried out for enhancing the performances of convolutional neural network (CNN) object detectors applied to municipal waste identification. In order to obtain an accurate and fast CNN architecture, several types of Single Shot Detectors (SSD) and Regional Proposal Networks (RPN) have been fine-tuned on the TrashNet database. The network with the best performances is executed on one autonomous robot system, which is able to collect detected waste from the ground based on the CNN feedback. For this type of application, a precise identification of municipal waste objects is very important. In order to develop a straightforward pipeline for waste detection, the paper focuses on boosting the performance of pre-trained CNN Object Detectors, in terms of precision, generalization, and detection speed, using different loss optimization methods, database augmentation, and asynchronous threading at inference time. The pipeline consists of data augmentation at the training time followed by CNN feature extraction and box predictor modules for localization and classification at different feature map sizes. The trained model is generated for inference afterwards. The experiments revealed better performances than all other Object Detectors trained on TrashNet or other garbage datasets with a precision of 97.63% accuracy for SSD and 95.76% accuracy for Faster R-CNN, respectively. In order to find the optimal higher and lower bounds of our learning rate where the network is actually learning, we trained our model for several epochs, updating the learning rate after each epoch, starting from 1 × 10−10 and decreasing it until reaching 1 × 10−1. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={The rapid urbanization process is escalating the urban waste problem, and ineffective management has worsened the issue, leading to severe consequences to the population health and economy. Although many countries have started to charge money for large household items, it is time-consuming and challenging for collectors to distinguish various types of bulky waste manually. As a result, this study introduces a mobile-based automatic bulky waste classification system. The original contributions include (1) a fine-tuned VGG-19 model is proposed to classify 95 types of bulky wastes; (2) three hybrid models are introduced to efficiently handle the imbalanced data problem, including class-weight VGG-19 (CW_VGG19), eXtreme Gradient Boosting VGG-19 (XGB_VGG19), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine VGG-19 (LGB_VGG19); (3) a large dataset that includes 95 classes, and each class contains over 500 images; and (4) the development of a mobile application that used the proposed model. Experiments show that the model obtained an accuracy of 86.19%, which outperforms existing models in classifying bulky waste. Moreover, the proposed hybrid models showed their robustness against imbalanced data under various scenarios. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Recycling of waste from households and industries, is one of the methods that has been proposed to reduce the ever-increasing pressure on landfills. Different types of waste types warrant different management techniques and hence, proper waste segregation according to its types is essential to facilitate proper recycling. Current existing segregation method still relies on manual hand-picking process. In this paper, a method; based on deep learning and computer vision concepts, to classify wastes using their images into six different waste types (glass, metal, paper, plastic, cardboard and others) has been proposed. Multiple-layered Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, specifically the well-known Inception-v3 model has been used for classification of waste, with trained dataset obtained from online sources. High classification accuracy of 92.5% is achievable using the proposed method. It is envisaged that the proposed waste classification method would pave the way for the automation of waste segregation with reduced human involvement and therefore, helps with the waste recycling efforts. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={Ongoing urbanization leads to steady growth of urban areas. In the case of highly dynamic change of municipalities, due to the rates of change, responsible administrations often are challenged or struggle with capturing present states of urban sites or accurately planning future urban development. An interest for urban planning lies on socio-economic conditions, as consumption and production of disposable goods are related to economic possibilities. Therefore, we developed an approach to generate relevant parameters for infrastructure planning by means of remote sensing and spatial analysis. In this study, the single building defines the spatial unit for the parameters. In the case city Belmopan (Belize), based on WorldView-1 data we manually define a city covering building dataset. Residential buildings are classified to eight building types which are locally adapted to Belmopan. A random forest (RF) classifier is trained with locally collected training data. Through household interviews focusing on household assets, income and educational level, a socio-economic point (SEP) scaling is defined, which correlates very well with the defined building typology. In order to assign socio-economic parameters to the single building, five socio-economic classes (SEC) are established based on SEP statistics for the building types. The RF building type classification resulted in high accuracies. Focusing on the three categories to describe residential socio-economic states allowed high correlations between the defined building and socio-economic points. Based on the SEP we projected a citywide residential socio-economic building classification to support supply and disposal infrastructure planning. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Water is an important resource for life and its existence and, unfortunately, large quantities of water are being wasted on a daily basis. Monitoring the consumption of water can control water usage, and smart technologies can play a useful role. In this paper, a smart system based on Internet of Things (IoT) has been proposed to monitor the water consumption in an urban housing complex. An ultrasonic sensor, together with Arduino, continuously monitors the water level of water tanks on rooftops and sends these data to a server through a Wi-Fi module. Using the data collected from the IoT system, the daily and weekly average water requirement of households can be calculated. Support vector machines (SVM) are used to forecast water consumption. The observed readings are divided into training and testing datasets. Water consumption is predicted for each day for a user. Error is recorded as the difference between the actual consumption and the predicted value, and it decreases as the number of days increase. An algorithm to monitor leakage of water in the tanks has also been proposed. A web interface allows the user to visualize the water usage, monitor their consumption, and detect any leakage and leakage rate in the system. © WA Publishing 2020},

The workers can segregate the huge amounts of waste into different categories by hand is the old method which affects the hygienic diseases and this method will takes a long time to classify the waste in the municipal areas. So, this paper implements the classification of waste material based on the image. Sorting is a multi-stage process used to classify the different objects into their specific categories. The current classification process requires conveniences to sort the waste by hand and use a series of large screens to separate out more defined object. The main objective of this project is to find an easy approach to differentiate different objects and classify them and group them according to their categories. In this process we use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Tensor Flow and Transfer Learning for the prediction of existing models. The approach is to take picture of the objects, classify the images and process them into different categories. The domain which we applied is the Deep learning using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm. It is defined by training the system with the large datasets which is used to identify the images and test set results will predict the accuracy results. The materials used for experimentation are-Cardboard Sheets, Plastic bottles, Glass items, Metals like tins, Sample papers like Whitepapers, Newspapers. This will bring an efficient time to sort the waste and it is the process of not getting any harm to anyone. By using this algorithm, it will predict the results more accurately. © 2020 SERSC.},

abstract={With the continuous acceleration of urbanization, the amount of municipal waste is increasing rapidly, and the problem of landfill is becoming more and more serious. Remote sensing (RS) technology has the characteristics of large-scale and high-frequency observation, which has significant advantages for the landfill detection. The traditional methods for detecting landfill are based on manual visual inspection and/or semi-manual interpretation. Those methods are usually costly, labor intensive, or low in efficiency and accuracy. For the above problems, this paper presents a detection method based on the deep learning technology. Firstly, 355 landfill images are searched and downloaded from Google Earth to build landfill datasets. Secondly, considering the difficulty of application and detection efficiency, YOLOv3 and YOLOv5 are selected for training. The model parameters are properly adjusted and tested in order to accurately identify the characteristics of the landfill.

abstract={Population explosion in India has led to an outburst of some major concerns, one of which is the waste generation and disposal system. India is accountable for producing 12% of the global municipal waste. As a result, waste is collectively dumped irrespective of the type leading to drainage blockages, pollution and diseases. In this paper, we have proposed a model for waste segregation that uses neural networks to classify waste images into three categories namely recyclable, non-recyclable and organic. A training accuracy of 83.77% and testing accuracy of 81.25% was obtained. Along with the proposed neural network, five standard CNN architectures – VGG-16, Dense-Net, Inception-Net, Mobile-Net and Res-Net are also tested on the given dataset. The highest test accuracy of 92.65% was obtained from the Mobile-Net classifier.

abstract={Automatic Waste Segregation is the process of classifying and separating waste objects into several categories for further treatment, it acts as a middle process between cumulative collection and waste treatment. Improper waste treatment not only causes pollution but also increases the overall cost of the waste treatment process, hence a proper waste segregation mechanism needs to be implemented before treatment. The paper is a successful attempt of creating a waste segregation mechanism with minimal cost and with minimal human intervention at household level with the help of deep learning specifically Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), image recognition and Internet of Things (IoT). The model classifies a waste as either biodegradable or non-biodegradable and segregates waste into separate compartments using a flap mechanism, the proposed model also sends feedback to the user in real time as when the bin requires maintenance. The neural network is trained using a large dataset consisting of approx. 13000 images combined with suitable hidden layers, 70-30 % images were used for training and testing respectfully. The proposed model gives accuracy of 92%. The classification and segregation happens in real time which helps to reduce overall human efforts and reduces cost of overall process. © 2020 Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt. Ltd.

abstract={Knowledge of higher heating value (HHV) is critically important in the techno-economic analysis and optimal performance of thermal waste-to-energy (WTE) systems. In this work, we proposed a rapid and cost-effective method to accurately estimate the high heating value for various municipal solid wastes using a novel machine learning technique and the ultimate analysis. To this end, we relied on a comprehensive experimental HHV dataset from a diverse range of geographical origins and eight various waste classifications (i.e., 30 paper, 12 textile, 12 rubber and leather, 29 MSW mixture, 34 plastic, 61 wood, 20 sewage sludge, and 53 other wastes). In particular, we developed nonlinear HHV equations for fast, accurate, straightforward applications (e.g., especially when limited elemental information is available) using robust gene expression programming (GEP) algorithm. Meanwhile, we analyzed the accuracy gains from the application of more complex and nonlinear models such as a novel support vector machine (RBAS-SVM) and a feed-forward neural network (FFNN). While coefficient of determination (R2) of the time-saving and straightforward GEP equations is 0.966, the SVM and FFNN models have 0.973 and 0.978 R2. Besides, root mean square error (RMSE) of GEP, SVM, and FFNN models are 1.57, 1.44, and 1.25, respectively. The results of statistical performances for the entire dataset showed that average absolute error (AAE) of the proposed models in a range of 0.87–1.12%. Finally, the presented models were compared to those developed by other authors regarding the comprehensiveness (dataset size and diversity), accuracy, and validity (statistical performances) for the entire dataset. © 2019},

abstract={The reduction of chemical pollution is a priority in many regional, national, and international policies, including in EU countries. To effectively do so, quantified overviews of pollutant emissions at national levels and with some granularity in their sources, are required. However, current monitoring efforts are often scattered and a quantitative and comprehensive inventory of toxic emissions in Europe is lacking. Toxic pollutants stem from a large variety of emission sources from industry, agriculture, households, etc. and the difficulty to cover all of them is manifest in public databases and official reports, where data gaps across countries and years exist for several substances. Here, we propose a methodology to tackle this problem and build comprehensive and harmonized national inventories of toxic pollutants. Using public databases, official reports, scientific literature and developing extrapolation techniques specific to each emission source, we derived harmonized annual inventories of toxic pollutants in all EU Member States over the years 2000–2014. They present an unprecedented coverage of 805, 572, and 468 substances emitted to air, water and soil, respectively. Although the resulting dataset shows a relatively good agreement with previous inventories of narrower scopes, uncertainties can be identified for specific emission sources and in the development of extrapolation techniques, thus calling for further research in these areas. Such efforts should also explore adaptation of the methodology to derive comprehensive inventories for countries outside EU, where data is scarcer. Nonetheless, the developed national inventories can provide a starting point for territorial chemical footprints of toxic pollutants and could be coupled with environmental impact assessment for gauging the damages to ecosystems and human health from toxic pollutants emitted in Europe. This can ultimately support policy-makers in their pollutants prioritisation and benchmarking across substances and countries towards improved toxic emission reduction policies. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={A simple balancing method using passive samplers over a week's period has been developed and tested successfully to determine elimination rates of 22 common micropollutants of household and industrial sources in 18 full-scale wastewater treatment plants of different design and performance. Independent reactor tests to delineate elimination rates with native sludge of the treatment plants correlated very well with the full-scale elimination rate determinations. As opposed to common assumptions, this large dataset indicated that shorter sludge retention times – read: higher active biomass – showed higher micropollutant elimination rates in many cases. Multivariate statistical analysis of the elimination rates over the 18 treatment plants was able to group compounds according to common degradation pathways and showed that sensitivity to SRT drove the grouping. The dataset also allowed to determine population equivalent normalized loads of the investigated micropollutants. The application of WWTP balancing with passive sampling makes it relatively easy to gather elimination rates and inlet loads on a much broader basis than before and gives orientation for more in-depth analysis of degradation pathways. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Nowadays, the growth rate of various diseases is gradually increasing and the incidence rate is younger. Health has become the most important topic for people. For effective prevention of disease from the mouth, people have increased their emphasis on food safety. Refrigerators, as an essential electrical appliance for household food storage, have become the target of mutual competition between many manufacturers. The basis of the intelligent research of refrigerator is to clarify the food inside the refrigerator. Therefore, the focus of this paper is how to effectively and accurately identify the food inside the refrigerator, so that users can know the type, quantity and freshness of the food in the refrigerator without opening the refrigerator. View food lists to prevent double purchases and reduce food waste. By comparing the popular algorithms such as YOLO, SSD, R-CNN, Fast-R-CNN and Faster-R-CNN, combined with the actual internal situation of the refrigerator, it is concluded that the SSD target detection algorithm is the optimal algorithm for identifying the food inside the refrigerator. After determining the optimal algorithm, this paper made a detailed comparison test with the VOC2007 dataset made by SSD300 and SSD512 algorithms. The experimental result is that SSD512 is better for identifying the food inside the refrigerator. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={The increase in global population and the improvement of living standards in developing countries has resulted in higher solid waste generation. Solid waste management increasingly represents a challenge, but it might also be an opportunity for the municipal authorities of these countries. To this end, the awareness of a variety of factors related to waste management and an efficacious in-depth analysis of them might prove to be particularly significant. For this purpose, and since data are both qualitative and quantitative, a cluster analysis specific for mixed data has been implemented on the dataset. The analysis allows us to distinguish two well-defined groups. The first one is poorer, less developed, and urbanized, with a consequent lower life expectancy of inhabitants. Consequently, it registers lower waste generation and lower CO2 emissions. Surprisingly, it is more engaged in recycling and in awareness campaigns related to it. Since the cluster discrimination between the two groups is well defined, the second cluster registers the opposite tendency for all the analyzed variables. In conclusion, this kind of analysis offers a potential pathway for academics to work with policy-makers in moving toward the realization of waste management policies tailored to the local context. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) is an indicator of organic pollution in freshwater bodies correlated to microbiological contamination. High BOD concentrations reduce oxygen availability, degrade aquatic habitats and biodiversity, and impair water use. High BOD loadings to freshwater systems are mainly coming from anthropogenic sources, comprising domestic and livestock waste, industrial emissions, and combined sewer overflows. We developed a conceptual model (GREEN + BOD ) to assess mean annual current organic pollution (BOD fluxes) across Europe. The model was informed with the latest available European datasets of domestic and industrial emissions, population and livestock densities. Model parameters were calibrated using 2008–2012 mean annual BOD concentrations measured in 2157 European monitoring stations, and validated with other 1134 stations. The most sensitive model parameters were abatement of BOD by secondary treatment and the BOD decay exponent of travel time. The mean BOD concentrations measured in monitored stations was 2.10 mg O 2 /L and predicted concentrations were 2.54 mg O 2 /L; the 90th percentile of monitored BOD concentration was 3.51 mg O 2 /L while the predicted one was 4.76 mg O 2 /L. The model could correctly classify reaches for BOD concentrations classes, from high to poor quality, in 69% of cases. High overestimations (incorrect classification by 2 or more classes) were 2% and large underestimations were 5% of cases. Across Europe about 12% of freshwater network was estimated to be failing good quality due to excessive BOD concentrations (&gt;5 mg O 2 /L). Dominant sources of BOD to freshwaters and seas were point sources and emissions from intensive livestock systems. Comparison with previous assessments confirms a decline of BOD pollution since the introduction of EU legislation regulating water pollution. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of RGBD-based detection and categorization of waste objects for nuclear decommissioning. To enable autonomous robotic manipulation for nuclear decommissioning, nuclear waste objects must be detected and categorized. However, as a novel industrial application, large amounts of annotated waste object data are currently unavailable. To overcome this problem, we propose a weakly supervised learning approach which is able to learn a deep convolutional neural network from unlabeled RGBD videos while requiring very few annotations. The proposed method also has the potential to be applied to other household or industrial applications. We evaluate our approach on the Washington RGB-D object recognition benchmark, achieving the state-of-the-art performance among semi-supervised methods. More importantly, we introduce a novel dataset, i.e., Birmingham nuclear waste simulants dataset, and evaluate our proposed approach on this novel industrial object recognition challenge. We further propose a complete real-time pipeline for RGBD-based detection and categorization of nuclear waste simulants. Our weakly supervised approach has demonstrated to be highly effective in solving a novel RGB-D object detection and recognition application with limited human annotations. © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The presence of waterborne microbial (including viral) pathogens, in wastewater poses a potential risk to human health when wastewaters are reused either directly or indirectly. Therefore, reuse activities need to be regulated in such a way as to protect human health and to this end, quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) has been successfully used to formulate evidence-based reuse regulations. The QMRA approach depends, however, on reliable information about the various elements of the system, including the wastewater treatment component. One point of major concern is the determination of pathogen concentrations, especially viral pathogens, in treated wastewater, as a consequence of their low levels and problems associated with the detection limit of enumeration methods. Therefore, the research described here aimed to develop stochastic simulations from empirical data to estimate likely concentrations of specified enteric microorganisms in final effluents of municipal wastewater treatment plants based on either activated sludge (AS) or trickling filter (TF) as the secondary biological treatment stage and thereby support the construction of functional QMRA models. Wastewater samples were collected every fortnight, during a twelve-month period, at each stage of four full-scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in southern England (two AS and two TF plants) (n = 360 samples) in order to build a robust dataset. Probability density functions (PDF) were then fitted to empirical data and used as input variables in the proposed model, which considered the concentration of the assessed micro-organisms in the raw wastewater and the removal rates in primary, secondary and tertiary treatment stages. Final concentrations of pathogenic and indicator organisms were then estimated using stochastic simulations. The proposed stochastic model was able to predict both accurately and reliably the likely concentration of microorganisms in the final effluent of both systems. Moreover, sensitivity analysis revealed that the concentrations of the microorganisms in raw wastewater and their removal rates in the secondary treatment stages had the greatest influence on the predictive output. It was therefore concluded that, provided due attention is paid to the quality of the specific input variables of the model, stochastic modelling may represent a valuable tool to support integrated water and sanitation safety planning approaches to human health risk management of wastewater reuse systems, based on the use of QMRA models. The approach may also support better design and operation of wastewater treatment processes so as to maximise pathogen removal in support of Sustainable Development Goal 6 Target 3 of the United Nations. © 2018},

abstract={Management options for digestate produced by anaerobic digestion plants influence the environmental and economic sustainability of the biogas sector. Further, digestate can be both used or disposed of according to its legal classification: that is, waste or by-product, or product (by using End of Waste procedure). Currently, legal digestate status is decided by EU member states on a case-by-case basis, according to specific positive lists of input feedstocks and quality requirements in terms of physical properties and chemical concentrations. Biased exclusion of input feedstock can force digestate to a specific waste classification and undergo post-treatment and disposal options that can negatively affect the profitability of biogas installations. This is the case of the Italian regulation, where the positive list of input feedstock excludes a priori separately collected organic fractions of municipal solid waste (OFMSW), while including agro-industrial residues (AGRO). This study determined the differences between the two digestate typologies (OFMSW versus AGRO) through statistical analysis, implemented on a dataset, designed to gather data about digestate's physical-chemical parameters from relevant scientific literature and unpublished private databases. The datasets consisted of 190 entries, derived from more than 2,000 samples. Further, the study provided a compliance assessment between the resulting parameter means and the current regulation limits. Upper confidence limits for the means (level of significance α = 0.05) calculated for both digestate typologies were found to be compliant with the legal requirements. Therefore, no statistical ratio seems to support the difference in the legislative approach as proposed by Italian law-makers. OFMSW resulted significantly different from AGRO for VS (650.1 g/kg TS vs. 843.8 g/kg TS, respectively), N-NH4 (81.9 g/kg TS vs. 46.19 g/kg TS), N-TOT (109.7 g/kg TS vs. 65.32 g/kg TS), P-TOT (7.22 g/kg TS vs. 21.9 g/kg TS), Pb (18.6 mg/kg TS vs. 4.66 mg/kg TS), Ni (11.03 mg/kg TS vs. 8.20 mg/kg TS), Cr-TOT (12.74 mg/kg TS vs. 8.74 mg/kg TS) and Hg (0.08 mg/kg TS vs. 0.05 mg/kg TS). However, the statistical analysis must be implemented on a wider set of parameters not covered by this study (e.g. ecotoxicological features). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The Velhas River sub-basin, which is located in the third-largest river basin in Brazil (São Francisco), is in an advanced state of degradation. In this work, the surface water quality of the Velhas River Basin was studied at 65 monitoring sites; 16 water quality parameters were sampled quarterly for 11 years (2008 to 2013). Cluster analysis (CA) and a nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test were associated with the analysis of violations to water quality standards to interpret the water quality data set from the Velhas River Basin and assess its spatial variations. The CA grouped the 65 monitoring sites into four groups. The Kruskal–Wallis test identified significant differences (p < 0.05) between the groups formed by CA. The results show that watercourses located in the upper region of the Velhas River Basin are more affected by the release of industrial effluent and domestic sewage, and the lower region is more affected by diffuse pollution and erosion. This association between multivariate statistical techniques and nonparametric tests was effective for the classification and processing of large water quality datasets and the identification of major differences between water pollution sources in the basin. Therefore, these results provide an understanding of the factors affecting water quality in the Velhas River Basin. The results can aid in decision-making by water managers and these methods can be applied to other river basins. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Lack of infrastructures, rapid growth in population, high urbanization and unsegregation makes the management of municipal solid waste a difficult task for local authorities. The paper proposes an approach for selecting the waste transfer station locations under unsegregated and segregated waste scenarios in an economical manner. The analytical approach is a combination of two basic components, (i) a mathematical optimization model for the overall cost of municipal solid waste management; and (ii) tools of a geographic information system for creating the dataset of the mathematical model. The novelty in the developed model includes strategic allocation of transfer stations for three scenarios: (i) solid waste collected from sources without segregation (Scenario (I)); (ii) waste collected considering source separation and transfer stations taking only one type of wastes (Scenario (II)); (iii) waste collected under source separation and transfer stations having multiple halls for multiple types of waste (Scenario (III)). The proposed approach has been verified by applying on city of Bilaspur, India. Optimization model selects six best locations for Scenario (I), (II) and five for Scenario (III). Results also show that among the three scenarios studied, scenario (III) is the best as it is providing more profit than scenario (II) and (I). Validity of the model is tested by ANOVA analysis and it suggested key parameters (frequency, operating cost and land value) as significant. This finding suggests that transfer stations with or without multiple halls under source separation environment can earn the profit from solid waste while solving the problem of high collection cost and landfills. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

A surveillance initiative across Canada has included sampling at 44 sites from July 2012 to March 2018. Triclosan was detected in 226 of 918 samples; concentrations ranged from less than 6 to 874 ng L −1 , and the detections averaged 54.23 ng L −1 (standard deviation; 97.6 ng L −1 ). However, using the entire dataset (including censored data estimated with the Kaplan–Meier model), the mean triclosan concentration was 17.95 ng L −1 , and the standard deviation was 52.84 ng L −1 . Three samples at Wascana Creek (downstream), Saskatchewan, had concentrations above the Federal Environmental Quality Guidelines of 470 ng L −1 , indicating a potential risk to the aquatic ecosystem. In this study, triclosan in samples collected downstream from municipal wastewater treatment plant discharges usually demonstrated higher concentrations than upstream samples. Based on the results of this study, it is hypothesized that triclosan concentration have fluctuated between years of this study but not in an overall or significant increase or decreasing trend. Triclosan concentrations and detections also are more prevalent in urban than in rural or mixed development rivers. Performance evaluation of triclosan concentrations in the Canadian environment is scheduled to be reassessed by 2024. Therefore, a 3-year sampling program should be in place across Canada by 2021. © 2018, Crown.},

In total, 190 life cycle inventories for processes within municipal solid waste management were either newly developed or adapted from existing datasets. The data for 51 recycling processes has been collected to update existing processes or create new process models. Two modules for biogenic processes were taken from literature and 10 processes were modeled based on the existing ecoinvent processes with minor adjustments [1]. The substitution of 36 materials from recycling processes was modeled. In addition, the thermal treatment of 12 waste fractions was modeled within 84 life cycle inventories compromising the thermal waste treatment and the recovery and recycling of recovered fractions from fly and bottom ash. The assumptions and the modelling of the waste treatment processes are described. All life cycle inventory datasets which were newly created, updated or modified compared to the original dataset are described and provided as Excel table.

abstract={The production of biogas by anaerobic digestion (AD) of agricultural residues, organic wastes, animal excrements, municipal sludge, and energy crops has a firm place in sustainable energy production and bio-economy strategies. Focusing on the microbial community involved in biomass conversion offers the opportunity to control and engineer the biogas process with the objective to optimize its efficiency. Taxonomic profiling of biogas producing communities by means of high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing provided high-resolution insights into bacterial and archaeal structures of AD assemblages and their linkages to fed substrates and process parameters. Commonly, the bacterial phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes appeared to dominate biogas communities in varying abundances depending on the apparent process conditions. Regarding the community of methanogenic Archaea, their diversity was mainly affected by the nature and composition of the substrates, availability of nutrients and ammonium/ammonia contents, but not by the temperature. It also appeared that a high proportion of 16S rRNA sequences can only be classified on higher taxonomic ranks indicating that many community members and their participation in AD within functional networks are still unknown. Although cultivation-based approaches to isolate microorganisms from biogas fermentation samples yielded hundreds of novel species and strains, this approach intrinsically is limited to the cultivable fraction of the community. To obtain genome sequence information of non-cultivable biogas community members, metagenome sequencing including assembly and binning strategies was highly valuable. Corresponding research has led to the compilation of hundreds of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) frequently representing novel taxa whose metabolism and lifestyle could be reconstructed based on nucleotide sequence information. In contrast to metagenome analyses revealing the genetic potential of microbial communities, metatranscriptome sequencing provided insights into the metabolically active community. Taking advantage of genome sequence information, transcriptional activities were evaluated considering the microorganism’s genetic background. Metaproteome studies uncovered enzyme profiles expressed by biogas community members. Enzymes involved in cellulose and hemicellulose decomposition and utilization of other complex biopolymers were identified. Future studies on biogas functional microbial networks will increasingly involve integrated multi-omics analyses evaluating metagenome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome datasets. © 2018, The Author(s).},

Samples were collected monthly from April 2015 to March 2016 in four municipal wastewater treatment plants that operate with activated sludge processes followed by different tertiary treatments (sand-anthracite filtration, membrane bioreactor/ reverse osmosis) and final chlorination. GB-124 phages were detected in 100% of the raw sewage samples, with viral loads varying from 7.5 × 10 3 to 1.32 × 10 6 PFU/L. Virus removal efficiency in activated sludge processes ranged from 1.89 to 2.31 log 10 . Frequencies of phage detection were lower in reclaimed water samples (0–22.2%). The results indicated that GB-124 phage could be a complementary low-cost viral marker for the detection of human fecal pollution in waters impacted with urban sewage in this region. However, the datasets of tertiary effluents resulted in several samples with concentrations below the detection limit (DL 1 PFU/mL) suggesting the need to obtain analytical methods with lower DL for greater accuracy of negative results. © IWA Publishing 2018.},

abstract={Incomplete removal during wastewater treatment leads to frequent detection of compounds such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products in municipal effluents. A fixed standard dilution factor of 10 for effluents entering receiving water bodies is used during the exposure assessment of several chemical risk assessments. However, the dilution potential of German receiving waters under low flow conditions is largely unknown and information is sparse for other European countries. We calculated dilution factors for two datasets differing in spatial extent and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) size: a national dataset comprising 1225 large WWTPs in Central and Northern Germany and a federal dataset for 678 WWTPs of a single state in Southwest Germany. We found that the fixed factor approach overestimates the dilution potential of 60% and 40% of receiving waters in the national and the federal dataset, with median dilution factors of 5 and 14.5, respectively. Under mean flow conditions, 8% of calculated dilution factors were below 10, with a median dilution factor of 106. We also calculated regional dilution factors that accounted for effluent inputs from upstream WWTPs. For the national and the federal dataset, 70% and 60% of calculated regional dilution factors fell below 10 under mean low flow conditions, respectively. Decrease of regional dilution potential in small receiving streams was mainly driven by the next WWTP upstream with a 2.5 fold drop of median regional dilution factors. Our results show that using the standard dilution factor of 10 would result in the underestimation of environmental concentrations for authorised chemicals by a factor of 3–5 for about 10% of WWTPs, especially during low flow conditions. Consequently, measured environmental concentrations might exceed predicted environmental concentrations and ecological risks posed by effluents could be much higher, suggesting that a revision of current risk assessment practices may be required. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Sanitation in neighbourhood and household domains can provide primary protection against diarrhea morbidity, yet their distinct health benefits have not been succinctly distinguished and reviewed. We present here the first systematic review and meta-analysis of the distinct effect of neighbourhood and household sanitation conditions on diarrhea morbidity. We identified studies reporting the effect of neighbourhood-level exposure to wastewater or household sanitation facilities on diarrhea, by performing comprehensive search on five databases, namely the Cochrane library, PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science, from the earliest date available to February 2015. Twenty-one non-randomized studies and one randomized controlled trial met the pre-determined inclusion criteria, consisting of six datasets on neighbourhood sanitation conditions (total 8271 subjects) and 20 datasets on household sanitation (total 20021 subjects). We calculated the pooled effect estimates of neighbourhood and household sanitation conditions on diarrhea morbidity using the inverse variance random-effects model. The pooled effect estimates showed that both neighbourhood sanitation conditions (odds ratio = 0.56, 95%CI: 0.40±0.79) and household sanitation (odds ratio = 0.64, 95%CI: 0.55±0.75) are associated with reduced diarrheal illness, and that the magnitudes of the associations are comparable. Evidence of risk of bias and heterogeneity were found in the included studies. Our findings confirm that both neighbourhood sanitation conditions and household sanitation are associated with considerable reduction in diarrhea morbidity, in spite of a number of methodological shortcomings in the included studies. Furthermore, we find evidence that neighbourhood sanitation conditions is associated with similar magnitude of reduction in diarrhea morbidity as household sanitation. The findings suggest that, in addition to household sanitation provision, dual emphasis on neighbourhood sanitation through public sanitation infrastructure provision and community-wide sanitation adoption is advisable for effective reduction of diarrheal disease burden. © 2017 Jung et al.

abstract={Anthropogenic material stocks are expanding at ever-increasing rates across the world, and their environmental and economic impacts draw more and more attention from academia, policy makers, and economic and environmental bodies. As the knowledge base regarding anthropogenic material stocks expands, it is important to not only comprehend the societal side of material stock growth but also its counterpart to the material balance—the natural environment from which the materials used for stocks come from. However, due to difficulties of data procurement, and muted interest in materials which are considered low-value high volume, the environmental burdens related to construction minerals have received less attention so far despite the huge amounts involved. In this study, we employ geographic information systems (GIS) with digital elevation model (DEM) datasets, to form an automated method of detection and measurement of the anthropogenic disturbance of soil and earth at excavation and mining sites, which accounts not only for the material extracted for usage in the anthroposphere, but also its related unused extraction. This geographically explicit method allows to directly pinpoint the location and volume of anthropogenic disturbance. Using Japan as a case study, the results suggest that the ratio of unused extraction to used extraction may exceed 1:1 for construction minerals in Japan. We also find that the environmental effects of anthropogenic activity are bigger than natural soil disturbance by several orders of magnitude, highlighting the need to reduce raw material extraction and increase the efficient use of the existing material stock. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The virus reduction efficiency of each unit process is commonly determined based on the ratio of virus concentration in influent to that in effluent of a unit, but the virus concentration in wastewater has often fallen below the analytical quantification limit, which does not allow us to calculate the concentration ratio at each sampling event. In this study, left-censored datasets of norovirus (genogroup I and II), and adenovirus were used to calculate the virus reduction efficiency in unit processes of secondary biological treatment and chlorine disinfection. Virus concentration in influent, effluent from the secondary treatment, and chlorine-disinfected effluent of four municipal wastewater treatment plants were analyzed by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach, and the probabilistic distributions of log reduction (LR) were estimated by a Bayesian estimation algorithm. The mean values of LR in the secondary treatment units ranged from 0.9 and 2.2, whereas those in the free chlorine disinfection units were from 0.1 and 0.5. The LR value in the secondary treatment was virus type and unit process dependent, which raised the importance for accumulating the data of virus LR values applicable to the multiple-barrier system, which is a global concept of microbial risk management in wastewater reclamation and reuse. © IWA Publishing 2016.},

abstract={Unsafe drinking water is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, especially among young children in low-income settings. We conducted a national survey in Rwanda to determine the level of faecal contamination of household drinking water and risk factors associated therewith. Drinking water samples were collected from a nationally representative sample of 870 households and assessed for thermotolerant coliforms (TTC), a World Health Organization (WHO)-approved indicator of faecal contamination. Potential household and community-level determinants of household drinking water quality derived from household surveys, the 2012 Rwanda Population and Housing Census, and a precipitation dataset were assessed using multivariate logistic regression. Widespread faecal contamination was present, and only 24.9% (95% CI 20.9–29.4%, n = 217) of household samples met WHO Guidelines of having no detectable TTC contamination, while 42.5% (95% CI 38.0–47.1%, n = 361) of samples had > 100 TTC/100 mL and considered high risk. Sub-national differences were observed, with poorer water quality in rural areas and Eastern province. In multivariate analyses, there was evidence for an association between detectable contamination and increased open waste disposal in a sector, lower elevation, and water sources other than piped to household or rainwater/bottled. Risk factors for intermediate/high risk contamination (> 10 TTC/100 mL) included low population density, increased open waste disposal, lower elevation, water sources other than piped to household or rainwater/bottled, and occurrence of an extreme rain event the previous day. Modelling suggests non-household-based risk factors are determinants of water quality in this setting, and these results suggest a substantial proportion of Rwanda's population are exposed to faecal contamination through drinking water. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The energy conversion potential of municipal solid waste (MSW) disposed of in landfills remains largely untapped because of the slow and variable rate of biogas generation, delayed and inefficient biogas collection, leakage of biogas, and landfill practices and infrastructure that are not geared toward energy recovery. A database consisting of methane (CH4) generation data, the major constituent of biogas, from 49 laboratory experiments and field monitoring data from 57 landfills was developed. Three CH4 generation parameters, i.e., waste decay rate (k), CH4 generation potential (L0), and time until maximum CH4 generation rate (tmax), were calculated for each dataset using U.S. EPA's Landfill Gas Emission Model (LandGEM). Factors influencing the derived parameters in laboratory experiments and landfills were investigated using multi-linear regression analysis. Total weight of waste (W) was correlated with biodegradation conditions through a ranked classification scheme. k increased with increasing percentage of readily biodegradable waste (Br 0 (%)) and waste temperature, and reduced with increasing W, an indicator of less favorable biodegradation conditions. The values of k obtained in the laboratory were commonly significantly higher than those in landfills and those recommended by LandGEM. The mean value of L0 was 98 and 88 L CH4/kg waste for laboratory and field studies, respectively, but was significantly affected by waste composition with ranges from 10 to 300 L CH4/kg. tmax increased with increasing percentage of biodegradable waste (B0) and W. The values of tmax in landfills were higher than those in laboratory experiments or those based on LandGEM's recommended parameters. Enhancing biodegradation conditions in landfill cells has a greater impact on improving k and tmax than increasing B0. Optimizing the B0 and Br 0 values of landfilled waste increases L0 and reduces tmax. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Physico-chemical waste composition data are paramount for the assessment and planning of waste management systems. However, the applicability of data is limited by the regional, temporal and technical scope of waste characterisation studies. As Danish and European legislation aims for higher recycling rates evaluation of source-segregation and recycling chains gain importance. This paper provides a consistent up-to-date dataset for 74 physico-chemical parameters in 49 material fractions from residual and 24 material fractions from source-segregated Danish household waste. Significant differences in the physico-chemical properties of residual and source-segregated waste fractions were found for many parameters related to organic matter, but also for elements of environmental concern. Considerable differences in potentially toxic metal concentrations between the individual recyclable fractions within one material type were observed. This indicates that careful planning and performance evaluation of recycling schemes are important to ensure a high quality of collected recyclables. Rare earth elements (REE) were quantified in all waste fractions analysed, with the highest concentrations of REE found in fractions with high content of mineral raw materials, soil materials and dust. The observed REE concentrations represent the background concentration level in non-hazardous waste materials that may serve as a reference point for future investigations related to hazardous waste management. The detailed dataset provided here can be used for assessments of waste management solutions in Denmark and for the evaluation of the quality of recyclable materials in waste. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Backpropgation neural network was trained to predict of combustible fraction heating value of MSW from the physical composition. Waste-to-Energy (WtE) is a viable option for municipal solid waste (MSW) management. The influence of the heating value of municipal solid waste (MSW) is very important on the implementation of WtE systems. As MSW is heterogeneous material, direct heating value measurements are often not feasible. In this study an empirical model was developed to describe the heating value of the combustible fraction of municipal solid waste as a function of its physical composition of MSW using backpropagation neural network. Sampling process was carried out at Jatibarang landfill. The weight of each sorting sample taken from each discharged MSW vehicle load is 100?kg. The MSW physical components were grouped into paper wastes, absorbent hygiene product waste, styrofoam waste, HD plastic waste, plastic waste, rubber waste, textile waste, wood waste, yard wastes, kitchen waste, coco waste, and miscellaneous combustible waste. Network was trained by 24 datasets with 1200, 769, and 210 epochs. The results of this analysis showed that the correlation from the physical composition is better than multiple regression method. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract={Bacteroidales and viruses were contemporaneously measured during dry and wet weather conditions at a watershed-scale in a semi-arid watershed impacted by a mixture of agricultural runoff, municipal wastewater effluent and municipal runoff. The results highlight the presence of municipal wastewater effluent as a confounding factor for microbial source tracking (MST) studies, and thus data were segregated into groups based on whether they were impacted by wastewater effluent. In semi-arid environments such as the Calleguas Creek watershed, located in southern California, the relative contribution of municipal wastewater effluent is dependent on hydrology as storm events lead to conditions where agricultural and municipal stormwater dominate receiving waters (rather than municipal wastewater, which is the case during dry weather). As such, the approach to data segregation was dependent on hydrology/storm conditions. Storm events led to significant increases in ruminant- and dog-associated Bacteroidales concentrations, indicating that overland transport connects strong non-human fecal sources with surface waters. Because the dataset had a large number of non-detect samples, data handling included the Kaplan-Meir estimator and data were presented graphically in a manner that reflects the potential effect of detection limits. In surface water samples with virus detections, Escherichiacoli concentrations were often below (in compliance with) the recreational water quality criteria. In fact, sites downstream of direct inputs of municipal wastewater effluent exhibited the lowest concentrations of E.coli, but the highest concentrations of human-associated Bacteroidales and highest detection rates of human viruses. The toolkit, comprised of the four Bacteroidales assays and human virus assays used, can be successfully applied to inform watershed managers seeking to comply with recreational water quality criteria. However, care should be taken when analyzing data to account for the effect of non-detect samples, sources with differing microbial viability, and diverging hydrologic conditions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In this research, determination of water quality status was carried out by using non-parametric Mann-Kendall analysis for the Linggi River Basin and for classification of the river, HACA and PCA has been used to classify the river to obtain the clearest picture of the water quality status. The dataset includes 6 parameters for 6 monitoring stations (1997 to 2012). Mann-Kendall trend analysis shows trend analysis indicate that significant improvement trend for all parameters studied except for BOD (WQ1 (P<0.1) and WQ6 (P<0.05)) and SS (WQ4 to WQ6 (P<0.05)) trend were shows the unhealthy significant trend. This indicates that even though the WQI getting good in trend, a few parameters such as BOD and SS need to be watched and enforcement by the local authority need to be done to make sure the WQI continuously getting better in the future. HACA grouped the six monitoring stations into three different clusters based on their similarities namely less pollution site (LPS), medium pollution site (MPS) and high pollution site (HPS). HACA indicate one station (WQ1) into group LPS, two stations into MPS (WQ2 and WQ3) and three stations into HPS (WQ4, WQ5 and WQ6) respectively. PCA was used to investigate the origin of each water quality variable based on the clustered region. Three principal components (PCs) were obtained with 75.3% total variation for HPS, 73.4% for MPS and 68.1% for LPS. The major pollution source for HPS are of anthropogenic source (municipal waste, domestic wastes) while for MPS the major source of pollution was from non point source pollution such as animal husbandry in livestock farm. For the LPS, major source comes from the sea tide effect (natural effect). The identification and classification of different region by this study will help the local authorities make better and more informed decisions about the improvement water quality program for the future. © 2015 Penerbit UTM Press.

abstract={A fosmid metagenomic library was constructed with total community DNA obtained from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWWTP), with the aim of identifying new FeFe-hydrogenase genes encoding the enzymes most important for hydrogen metabolism. The dataset generated by pyrosequencing of a fosmid library was mined to identify environmental gene tags (EGTs) assigned to FeFe-hydrogenase. The majority of EGTs representing FeFe-hydrogenase genes were affiliated with the class Clostridia, suggesting that this group is the main hydrogen producer in the MWWTP analyzed. Based on assembled sequences, three FeFe-hydrogenase genes were predicted based on detection of the L2 motif (MPCxxKxxE) in the encoded gene product, confirming true FeFe-hydrogenase sequences. These sequences were used to design specific primers to detect fosmids encoding FeFe-hydrogenase genes predicted from the dataset. Three identified fosmids were completely sequenced. The cloned genomic fragments within these fosmids are closely related to members of the Spirochaetaceae, Bacteroidales and Firmicutes, and their FeFe-hydrogenase sequences are characterized by the structure type M3, which is common to clostridial enzymes. FeFe-hydrogenase sequences found in this study represent hitherto undetected sequences, indicating the high genetic diversity regarding these enzymes in MWWTP. Results suggest that MWWTP have to be considered as reservoirs for new FeFe-hydrogenase genes. © 2014 Institut Pasteur.},

abstract={The continuous flow of resources through the economy is the origin of most of the environmental problems evident today. These problems are directly related to production and introduction of wastes and pollutants into the natural environment. The study investigated the relationship between household waste and geodemographic grouping (GDG) at the municipal level across England.A correlation analysis of the GDG and waste data revealed a positive relationship between waste and proportion of different GDG. A robust regression model generated represents 74% of the variation across the dataset, and it shows that there is a significant relationship between municipal waste and GDG. A higher number of GDG (e.g. 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8) displayed a very strong association with increasing total municipal household waste (TMHW). GDG such as 1, 2 and 10, despite their higher disposable incomes, displayed a weak association with TMHW. Furthermore, GDGs such as 8, 3, 7, 4 and 6 generated more household waste in comparison to GDG. This model provides an understanding that can influence the organisation of waste management programmes and forecasting of municipal waste. It also provides essential input for decisions in structuring promotion of sustainable behaviour and implementing local initiatives to support such activities. © The Author(s) 2014.},

abstract={Widespread use of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) in consumer products has led to concerns about their potential impact on humans and the environment. In order to fully assess the impacts and release of ENMs from consumer products, this chapter provides an overview of the types of consumer products that contain nanomaterials, the potential release mechanisms of these ENMs from consumer products, and the associated human exposure. Information from two large datasets on consumer goods associated with ENMs, namely, the U.S.-based Project for Emerging Nanotechnologies from the Woodrow Wilson International Center, and the European-based National Institute for Public Health and the Environment of Netherlands, have been summarized. These databases reveal that silver, titanium, carbon-based ENMs are the major nanomaterials associated with consumer products. The presence and potential release of silver, titanium, carbon-based, and other nanomaterials from consumer goods available in published literature are also summarized, as well as the potential human exposure scenarios of inhalation, ingestion, dermal, and combination of all means. The prospecting of nanomaterial in water and biosolids provides further evidence of ENM occurrence, which could be linked to the use of nanomaterials containing consumer goods. Finally, this overview provides guidelines on toxicity studies, which calls for further efforts to analyze the biological effects of ENMs on human beings and their exposure pathways in consumer products. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={Prediction methods combining clustering and classification techniques have the potential of creating more accurate results than the individual techniques, particularly for large datasets. In this paper, a hybrid prediction method is proposed from combining weighted k-means clustering and linear regression. Weighted k-means is used to cluster the dataset. Then, linear regression is performed on each cluster to build the final predictors. The proposed method has been applied to the problem of municipal waste prediction and evaluated with a dataset including 63,000 records. The results showed that it outperforms the single application of linear regression and k-means clustering in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness. The prediction model is integrated into a decision support system for strategic and operational planning of waste and recycling services at the City of Calgary in Canada. The potential usage of the prediction model is to improve the resource utilization, like personnel and vehicles. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The present study applied both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches to characterize microbial structure and gene expression of an activated sludge community from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Hong Kong. DNA and cDNA were sequenced by Illumina Hi-seq2000 at a depth of 2.4 Gbp. Taxonomic analysis by MG-RAST showed bacteria were dominant in both DNA and cDNA datasets. The taxonomic profile obtained by BLAST against SILVA SSUref database and annotation by MEGAN showed that activated sludge was dominated by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia phyla in both DNA and cDNA datasets. Global gene expression annotation based on KEGG metabolism pathway displayed slight disagreement between the DNA and cDNA datasets. Further gene expression annotation focusing on nitrogen removal revealed that denitrification-related genes sequences dominated in both DNA and cDNA datasets, while nitrifying genes were also expressed in relative high levels. Specially, ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine oxidase demonstrated the high cDNA/DNA ratios in the present study, indicating strong nitrification activity. Enzyme subunits gene sequences annotation discovered that subunits of ammonia monooxygenase (amoA, amoB, amoC) and hydroxylamine oxygenase had higher expression levels compared with subunits of the other enzymes genes. Taxonomic profiles of selected enzymes (ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine oxygenase) showed that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria present mainly belonged to Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira species and no ammonia-oxidizing Archaea sequences were detected in both DNA and cDNA datasets. © 2012 Yu, Zhang.},

abstract={Growing production of municipal solid waste in the recent years caused by increasing global levels of economic activity needs more sophisticated management tools for its collection. Despite some local efforts to reduce the waste, disposal in landfills is still the most predominate way. Considering to restrictive environmental regulations, more efficient and sustainable systems of municipal solid waste management are carried out to protect our living environment. They deal with the waste sorting, which is mainly focused on categories represented by paper, mixed plastics, mixed glass, mixed waste, hazardous waste and metals. Thus, specific transport vehicles and optimized routes are needed to manage the collection of all the waste categories from local sites to landfills, incineration plants, collecting yards and recovery sites. This contribution presents the waste collection methods based on spatial analysis and operations research. The spatial analysis is focused on development of the road network datasets for waste collection, finding the best routes, defining the service area and creating the origin-destination cost matrix in geographic information systems (GISs). The identified routes and local service areas together with the cost per unit and the total amount of the transported waste form data inputs into operations research. The transportation problem in linear programming is used to optimize the total cost for transportation of each waste category in the framework of municipal solid waste collection. As an example, the urban areas of Prague are included into a case study to illustrate spatial modeling in the GIS environment and optimization focused on collection networks. The individual collection sites are grouped into the urban areas. Waste production in each urban area is estimated in dependence on available data from reports about the living environment in Prague. The locations of target collection points represented by recycling places, incineration plants and landfills are based on larger urban districts. The developed GIS project can manage various scenarios, which indicate different total costs. In spite of its actual lower total cost, the landfill will become more difficult to implement due to the increasing cost caused by limited land availability and environmental community opposition. On the other hand, the recovery/recycling will become more important because of its minimal negative interaction with the living environment. In order to minimize the costs and degradation of our living environment, spatial modeling extended by methods focused on linear programming can assist to find suitable waste management scenarios for collection of municipal solid waste in urban areas. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.
