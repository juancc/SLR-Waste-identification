Abstract = {{Municipal solid waste (MSW) management (MSWM) is most important and
   challenging in large urban communities. Sound community-based waste
   management systems normally include waste reduction and material
   recycling elements, often entailing the separation of recyclable
   materials by the residents. To increase the efficiency of source
   separation and recycling, an incentive-based source separation model was
   designed and this model was tested in 76 households in Guiyang, a city
   of almost three million people in southwest China. This model embraced
   the concepts of rewarding households for sorting organic waste,
   government funds for waste reduction, and introducing small recycling
   enterprises for promoting source separation. Results show that after one
   year of operation, the waste reduction rate was 87.3\%, and the
   comprehensive net benefit under the incentive-based source separation
   model increased by 18.3 CNY tonne(-1) (2.4 Euros tonne(-1)), compared to
   that under the normal model. The stakeholder analysis (SA) shows that
   the centralized MSW disposal enterprises had minimum interest and may
   oppose the start-up of a new recycling system, while small recycling
   enterprises had a primary interest in promoting the incentive-based
   source separation model, but they had the least ability to make any
   change to the current recycling system. The strategies for promoting
   this incentive-based source separation model are also discussed in this
   study.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this study is to classify domestic waste via
   computer vision and sort it automatically according to the four-category
   regulation. A novel two-stage Waste Recognition-Retrieval algorithm
   (W2R) is proposed. Its first stage was to train a Recognition Model
   (RegM) recognizing waste into one of thirteen subcategories. The second
   stage was to construct the Recognition-Retrieval Model (RevM)
   classifying the recognized subcategory into one of four categories.
   Meanwhile, a one-stage waste Classification Model (ClfM) was trained as
   a comparison. Both best-performing models were selected and installed
   respectively onto the automatic sorting machine for contrast experiment
   classifying a set of waste. The machine consisted of three main modules:
   the Computer-Vision Module, the Sorting Module, and the Customized
   Module. It was also a platform for data collection. Ten participants
   also classified and sorted the same set of waste in the experiment of

Abstract = {{Worldwide, public managers need to plan and implement sustainable
   alternatives for the management of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) that
   consider waste treatment plants. However, the selection of waste
   treatment alternatives is a complex process which must consider
   different criteria. In this sense, the present article had the objective
   of analyzing different MSW treatment alternatives for the municipality
   of Juazeiro do Norte in Ceara, Brazil, through the evaluation of
   economic, environmental, social, technical, and regulatory criteria. The
   Multicriteria Decision Making Method AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process)
   was applied, supported by several quantitative techniques of projection
   and data collected in the field and in secondary sources. The results
   show that alternatives 1 (decentralized manual sorting center and
   composting units) and 3 (decentralized manual sorting center and
   anaerobic digesters) are the most favorable MSW treatment options for
   Juazeiro do Norte, with a percentage of 25,11 and 24,97\%, respectively.
   The decentralized alternatives 1 and 3 have an advantage over the
   centralized alternatives 2 (automated sorting center and centralized
   composting unit), 4 (automated sorting center and centralized
   biodigester) and 5 (automated sorting center and incinerator) due,
   mainly, to the greater generation of jobs and technical feasibility.
   However, sensitivity analyzes enhances that, in an evaluation in which
   the economic criteria had a weight greater than or equal to 70\%, the
   overall result would change significantly and the centralized
   alternatives 2 and 4, alternatives with better economic results, would
   be considered as the best MSW treatment options.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of domestic refuse is becoming more and more serious with
   the use of all kinds of equipment in medical institutions. This matter
   arouses people?s attention. Traditional artificial waste classification
   is subjective and cannot be put accurately; moreover, the working

   automated and effective sorting is needed. In view of the current
   development of deep learning, it can provide a good auxiliary role for
   classification and realize automatic classification. In this paper, the
   ResNet-50 convolutional neural network based on the transfer learning
   method is applied to design the image classifier to obtain the domestic
   refuse classification with high accuracy. By comparing the method
   designed in this paper with back propagation neural network and
   convolutional neural network , it is concluded that the CNN based on
   transfer learning method applied in this paper with higher accuracy rate
   and lower false detection rate. Further, under the shortage situation of
   data samples, the method with transfer learning and ResNet-50 training
   model is effective to improve the accuracy of image classification.}},

Abstract = {{The recycling of plastics from Waste electrical and electronic equipment
   (WEEE) was constrained by the mix of types. Near-infrared (NIR)
   spectroscopy is suitable for polymer detection, and it is a rapid,
   non-destructive analysis method that can be applied to automatic on-line

   plastics, which are polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), acrylonitrile
   butadiene styrene (ABS), and acrylonitrile butadiene
   styrene/polycarbonate (ABS/PC) blend, was collected. The flame-retardant
   ABS showed difference from ABS in NIR spectra. Three classification
   methods, which are spectral angle mapper (SAM), partial least squares
   discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and linear discriminant analysis combined
   with principal component analysis (PCA-LDA), was tested. And the
   classification models trained on the virgin plastics have been compared
   with the models trained on the WEEE plastic to evaluate how these
   methods perform under limited training data. PLS-DA is one of the most
   widely used classification method in spectral data analysis, but it had
   unsuccessful prediction when the training set only included virgin
   plastics. But the overall prediction accuracy over 99\% could be
   achieved by the other two whether the training set was the spectra of

Abstract = {{Recycling of post-consumer packaging wastes involves a complex chain of
   activities, usually based on three main stages, that is: i) collection

   contaminants detection and separation play a preeminent role. The
   utilization of a Near InfraRed (NIR) - HyperSpectral Imaging (HSI) based

   HSI-based sorting logics, to apply, to implement, to set up and to

   classification model allows to recognize polymeric fragments from
   cellulosic ones and to identify multi-layer materials (i.e. laminated
   plastic and laminated cardboard). The misclassified fragments are
   constituted by laminated plastics. The set up cascade model reached in

Abstract = {{Domestic waste classification was incorporated into legal provisions

   domestic waste is highly inefficient. To that end, in this article, we
   propose a multimodel cascaded convolutional neural network (MCCNN) for

   subnetworks (DSSD, YOLOv4, and Faster-RCNN) to obtain the detections.
   Moreover, to suppress the false-positive predicts, we utilized a
   classification model cascaded with the detection part to judge whether
   the detection results are correct. To train and evaluate MCCNN, we
   designed a large-scale waste image dataset (LSWID), containing 30 000
   domestic waste multilabeled images with 52 categories. To the best of
   our knowledge, the LSWID is the largest dataset on domestic waste
   images. Furthermore, a smart trash can is designed and applied to a
   Shanghai community, which helped to make waste recycling more efficient.

Abstract = {{Modern world meets a lot of challenges that includes smart waste
   management system. It becomes a big concern if proper disposal system is
   not managed. Managing of waste effectively and recycling efficiently is
   a major goal for every nation. There are many automatic waste material
   sorting facilities available, which are being used to sort metals,
   plastics and glass bottle wastes. Sorting plastics based on type of
   plastics, makes the plastics recycling process more effective. But
   segregation and sorting of black coloured plastics is a major problem
   while sorting plastics based on their types. Also, black plastics
   contains many harmful chemicals like bromide and other heavy metals,
   which may contaminate other recycling processes of plastics. Black
   plastics are used as food containers which leads to serious health
   concern. In this research work, the difficulty of sorting black plastics
   is done by developing an electromechanical system using microcontroller,
   which sorts all types of plastics. For sorting black plastic wastes,
   calibrated sensors and optimized algorithms have been developed and
   used. This sorting process makes plastics recycling process more
   effective. This automatic sorting machine and effective recycling of
   domestic wastes will make our environment more suitable for living.

Abstract = {{Municipal solid waste (MSW), generated at an unprecedented rate due to
   rapid urbanization and industrialization contains useful recyclable
   materials like metals, plastic, wood, etc. Recycling of useful materials
   from MSW in the developing countries is severely constrained by limited
   door-to-door collection and poor means of segregation. Recovery of
   recyclables is usually performed by waste pickers, which is highly risky
   and hazardous for their health. This paper reports the development of a
   robotic mobile manipulation system for automated sorting of useful
   recyclables from MSW. The developed robot is equipped with a thermal
   imaging camera, proximity sensor and a 5-DOF robotic aria. This paper
   presents an approach for sorting based on automated identification from
   thermographic images. The developed algorithm extracts keypoint features
   from the thermographic image and feeds into clustering model to map them
   into a bag of-word vectors. Finally, Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   classifier is used for identifying the recyclable material. We used the
   developed algorithm to detect three categories of recyclables namely,
   aluminum can, plastic bottle and tetra pack from given thermographic
   images. We obtained classification rate of 94.3\% in the tests. In
   future, we plan to extend the developed approach for classifying a wider
   range of recyclable objects as well as to incorporate motion planning
   algorithms to handle cluttered environments.}},

Abstract = {{With rapid population growth and urbanization, municipal solid waste
   (MSW) generation rates are rising around the world. Incineration is
   considered as an effective way to deal with the growing demand for MSW
   disposal. The prediction of concentrations of pollutants generated from
   MSW incineration plants is a powerful support for waste incineration
   process control, which aims to reduce pollutant emissions. This paper
   proposes a two-stage prediction method based on the long short-term
   memory (LSTM) network to forecast typical flue gas pollutants of an MSW
   incineration plant in South China. In the first stage, an LSTM-based
   classification model is utilized to determine whether the pollutants are
   at a low level, and over-sampling strategy is applied to deal with the
   class-imbalance problem. At the second stage, an LSTM-based prediction
   model is built to further estimate the amounts of pollutants. Besides,
   the sliding average method is used to process the multi-scale raw data.
   Experiment results proved the effectiveness of the proposed method and
   indicated how different inputs affect the forecasting of pollutant
   emissions.}},

Abstract = {{There is a general phenomenon of incoordination between garbage
   classification management and participation behavior, which seriously
   affects the sustainable management efficiency of domestic garbage. In
   order to solve this problem, this paper introduced the
   subject-object-process model into the waste classification management
   system, and constructed a mandatory classification management model of
   municipal solid waste and a comprehensive evaluation index system.
   Taking Beijing, China, as an example, the coupling coordination degree
   of garbage classification behaviors of residents in different was
   compared, and the coordination status of household waste management and
   behaviors was obtained. The results show that the synergy between
   government management and residents' household waste classification
   behavior is between 0.40 and 0.68, and the synergy between enterprises'
   participation in governance and residents' behavior is between 0.45 and
   0.75. The coordination degree between domestic waste management and
   residents' participation behavior is generally in primary coordination
   or slight imbalance. The synergy degree between the secondary indicators
   of domestic waste management and residents' behavior is higher than that
   of the tertiary indicators. Superposition effect of integrated
   management measures is better; among the psychological factors affecting
   residents' classification behavior, the awareness rate and recognition
   degree of waste classification are very high, the awareness of
   environmental responsibility and social pressure are lagging behind. The
   study of synergy under the framework of subject-object-process not only
   quantifies the overall synergy between management and residents'
   behavior, but also provides a method to further implement garbage
   classification management in a targeted manner. Based on the synergy
   analysis, according to the weak links of various regions, classified
   management is carried out around publicity and education, supervision

Abstract = {{Development of a Municipal Solid Waste Management (MSWM) plan is a
   complex process. As a foundation and prerequisite for efficient MSWM
   plan, quantification and prediction of Solid Waste (SW) generation is
   very much essentials. Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) prediction cannot be
   done directly and depends on so many factors. In actual practices, due
   to uncertainties and unavailability of sufficient data, modelling
   methods are needed for prediction of MSW generation. A number of
   researchers have predicted SW generation using various modeling methods.
   The main objective of this paper is to review such models related to MSW
   generation using economic, socio-demographic or management-orientated
   data and identify possible factors that will help in selecting the
   crucial design options within the framework of mathematical modeling.
   Five characteristic classification criteria, namely, modeling method,
   area covered, time series, independent variables and waste streams are
   focused in this review. The entire published models are diverse in
   nature for application from whole country to households. Successful
   modeling depends significantly on selection of waste stream. From the
   review and discussion of models the research aims to identify the
   limitations of previous models which will help in identifying the
   crucial design options within the framework of modeling. The study is
   concluded with a few fruitful suggestions. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{242}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Biowaste is one of the predominant fractions in municipal waste. Its
   easy degradation in the ground causes the emission of polluting gases
   and generates leachate, which pose a great environmental risk. Defining
   solutions for biowaste management may have a number of varied, sometimes
   opposing objectives, and involve several linked stages. This article
   presents a new tool for the planning of biowaste management systems. The
   tool distinguishes four stages within the waste management line:
   collection (defined by the separation model and the collection system),
   pre-treatment, treatment, and application. Several alternatives are
   considered for each stage. The different combinations of alternatives
   that define the management systems are evaluated in two phases. First,
   the compatibility matrix establishes the affinity between the
   alternatives selected for each stage and then each alternative is
   assessed using indicators associated with environmental, social,
   technical and economic criteria. Both management alternatives and
   criteria considered in the tool can be modified or extended according to
   the local circumstances. The paper describes a case study that shows the
   value of the tool as an aid in decision-making for alternative selection
   in waste management systems under different scenarios and priorities.

Abstract = {{In the U.K., between 7.6 m(3) to 76m(3) of water is lost annually in
   each residence through leaks. In contrast to the ongoing improvement on
   water distribution network leakage detection technologies, research on
   water leakage at the domestic level has been limited. Identification of
   large flow rate leaks (i.e. Llmin. with floods or bursts) through the
   analysis of the household water consumption is highly feasible. However,
   micro-flow rate leaks (i.e. mL/min.) tend to be overlooked and can
   therefore waste hundreds of liters of water before detection. This,
   alongside increasing awareness of water quality and resource protection,
   mandates further investigation of micro-leak detection systems. An
   innovative micro-leak detection system for domestic applications that
   utilizes an ultrasonic flowmeter in a new shunt configuration is
   proposed. Unlike conventional water leakage detection systems, the
   proposed automated system is highly sensitive (detected leaks of 1
   mL/min.) and does not impede the main flow. The micro-leak detection
   system is completely automated as it employs a: USB-powered voltmeter,
   USB-powered flowmeter and USB-powered switches. An elegant feature is
   that the system is remotely controlled across the Globe; thus, allowing
   large-scale data collection and system control. This system circumvents
   water leaks on any scale, anywhere in the world. This latter feature is
   beyond the reach of the complex conventional detection methods. The
   de-noising property of Wavelet transform is carried out on the remotely
   collected data from the ultrasonic flowmeter to remove unwanted noise.}},

Abstract = {{This work aims to classify seven common household plastic types which
   include polyethylene terephthalate (PET), high density polyethylene
   (HDPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), low density polyethylene (LDPE),
   polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and polycarbonate (PC) utilizing
   near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. Four methods including linear
   discriminant analysis (LDA), partial least-squares discriminant analysis
   (PLS-DA), spectral angle mapper (SAM), and support vector machine (SVM)
   were tested for their classification performances, and principal
   component analysis (PCA) was applied before LDA and SVM. All the
   classification models were built based on virgin plastics. The results
   showed that seven types of plastic could be classified excellently with
   all the methods when the test sets were composed of virgin samples. When
   the models were tested on waste plastics, most types could be well
   classified, and all the misclassifications occurred between HDPE and
   LDPE and PET and PC. Then for HDPE and LDPE and PET and PC that were
   prone to be misidentified, some specific spectral bands were reselected
   for further classification. To achieve the best result, an approach
   combining PCA, SVM, LDA, and PLS-DA was presented. The validation
   results showed significant improvement, with the F1 scores of LDPE and

Abstract = {{Remote sensing of the Earth allows to receive information of medium, a
   high spatial resolution from space vehicles and to conduct hyperspectral
   measurements. In many cases, waste disposal sites (WDS) is not legal.
   So, it is very important to use the system for automatic detection such
   places using satellite images. In this paper, a model of the automated
   space monitoring system for the presence of waste disposal sites is
   developed. The proposed system includes the following blocks: a database
   of WDS; a subsystem for detecting unauthorized WDS; a subsystem for
   monitoring the design, operation and reclamation rules for existing WDS;
   a subsystem for estimating the parameters of the WDS and their impact on
   the environment; a subsystem of satellite monitoring. We propose a
   method of detecting high-rise buildings landfills, such as municipal
   dumps and solid waste, according to a radar image (the height of the
   ground level). For system design, we use the apparatus of discrete
   orthogonal transformations. The impact of the WDS influence on
   agricultural crops is analyzed, based on the data of the Earth remote
   space sensing based on the orthogonal transform. The purpose of the work
   is the modeling of an automated space monitoring system for the presence
   of waste disposal facilities using regularization method in the problem
   of filtering of space images from the noise stored in the archives. As a
   result, the proposed method demonstrates good accuracy in detection the
   solid waste disposal site on real satellite images.}},

Abstract = {{Automated waste sorting can dramatically increase waste sorting
   efficiency and reduce its regulation cost. Most of the current methods
   only use a single modality such as image data or acoustic data for waste
   classification, which makes it difficult to classify mixed and
   confusable wastes. In these complex situations, using multiple
   modalities becomes necessary to achieve a high classification accuracy.
   Traditionally, the fusion of multiple modalities has been limited by
   fixed handcrafted features. In this study, the deep-learning approach
   was applied to the multimodal fusion at the feature level for municipal
   solid-waste sorting. More specifically, the pre-trained VGG16 and
   one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNNs) were utilized to
   extract features from visual data and acoustic data, respectively. These
   deeply learned features were then fused in the fully connected layers
   for classification. The results of comparative experiments proved that
   the proposed method was superior to the single-modality methods.
   Additionally, the feature-based fusion strategy performed better than
   the decision-based strategy with deeply learned features.}},

Abstract = {{Plastic waste management is a challenge for the whole world. Manual
   sorting of garbage is a difficult and expensive process, which is why
   scientists create and study automated sorting methods that increase the
   efficiency of the recycling process. The plastic waste may be
   automatically chosen on a transmission belt for waste removal by using
   methods of image processing and artificial intelligence, especially deep
   learning, to improve the recycling process. Waste segregation techniques
   and procedures are applied to major groups of materials such as paper,
   plastic, metal, and glass. Though, the biggest challenge is separating
   different materials types in a group, for example, sorting different
   colours of glass or plastics types. The issue of plastic garbage is
   important due to the possibility of recycling only certain types of
   plastic (PET can be converted into polyester material). Therefore, we
   should look for ways to separate this waste. One of the opportunities is
   the use of deep learning and convolutional neural network. In household
   waste, the most problematic are plastic components, and the main types
   are polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene. The main problem
   considered in this article is creating an automatic plastic waste
   segregation method, which can separate garbage into four mentioned
   categories, PS, PP, PE-HD, and PET, and could be applicable on a sorting
   plant or home by citizens. We proposed a technique that can apply in
   portable devices for waste recognizing which would be helpful in solving
   urban waste problems.}},

Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{156}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Studies to date have shown that individual pro-environmental motivations
   do not always translate into pro-environmental behaviors. An important
   factor that modifies motivational strength is the context in which the
   behavior is embedded. Previous studies have largely been cross-national
   analyses that focus on macro-contextual factors, thus ignoring
   substantial variation in motivation-behavior associations at the local
   scale. In contrast, this study investigated the way micro-contextual
   mechanisms in residential areas (housing estates and communities)
   moderate the behavioral effects of personal values, one of the most
   fundamental motivations that guide individual environmental behaviors.
   Four contextual factors with particular attention were community
   environmental initiatives, social capital, local demographics, and built
   characteristics.
   The research data derived from a large-scale survey in Hangzhou, China,
   where community initiatives have been implemented widely to target
   household waste source separation. We examined our cross-level model for
   both waste sorting and nontarget environmental behaviors. The results
   showed that the associations between self-transcendent value
   prioritizations and waste sorting were stronger in residential areas
   with lower populations or community initiatives' greater reliance on
   public-interest framing. Associations between value prioritizations and
   nontarget private behaviors were stronger in areas with lower social
   capital, more females, or more communal space for neighbor interactions.
   However, no contextual factors changed the strength of the links between
   value prioritizations and public behaviors. Overall, these findings
   highlight the significant role of micro-contextual factors in explaining
   the variations in motivation-behavior links. They also indicate that the
   characteristics of environmental behavior may moderate the dynamics
   between pro-environmental motivations and contextual factors further.}},

Abstract = {{Material flow analysis can effectively trace and quantify the flows and
   stocks of materials such as solid wastes in urban environments. However,
   the integrity of material flow analysis results is compromised by data
   uncertainties, an occurrence that is particularly acute in
   low-and-middle-income study contexts. This article investigates the
   uncertainties in the input data and their effects in a material flow
   analysis study of municipal solid waste management in Maputo City, the
   capital of Mozambique. The analysis is based on data collected in 2007
   and 2014. Initially, the uncertainties and their ranges were identified
   by the data classification model of Hedbrant and Sorme, followed by the
   application of sensitivity analysis. The average lower and upper bounds
   were 29\% and 71\%, respectively, in 2007, increasing to 41\% and 96\%,
   respectively, in 2014. This indicates higher data quality in 2007 than
   in 2014. Results also show that not only data are partially missing from
   the established flows such as waste generation to final disposal, but
   also that they are limited and inconsistent in emerging flows and
   processes such as waste generation to material recovery (hence the wider
   variation in the 2014 parameters). The sensitivity analysis further
   clarified the most influencing parameter and the degree of influence of
   each parameter on the waste flows and the interrelations among the
   parameters. The findings highlight the need for an integrated municipal
   solid waste management approach to avoid transferring or worsening the
   negative impacts among the parameters and flows.}},

Abstract = {{There is consensus that environmental issues are consequences of human
   activities and can be addressed by improvements in behavior. Separation
   of waste at the source (SAS) as mandated through Act 672 is a
   proenvironmental behavior (PEB) at the household level to reduce waste
   from being send to landfill and also an effective measure in reducing
   waste as a whole which will ultimately protect the environment from
   pollution. Based on the problem statement that lack of household
   knowledge on how to perform the separation of waste and holding
   environmental ethics that is not pro-environment will hinder household
   from performing such behavior, this article aims to establish a
   conceptual model of separation of waste at the source among households
   in Malaysia. The conceptual model proposed a modification to
   Value-Belief-Norm (VBN) model to predict SAS behavior with environmental
   ethics and specific waste separation knowledge as an adjustment and
   additional factors to the original model which could demonstrate the
   causal-effect relationship towards the behavior. The conceptual model
   proposed individuals with biocentric and ecocentric beliefs to be more
   likely to engage in SAS behavior than those with anthropocentric and
   technocentric beliefs. The conceptual model also proposed that
   individuals specific waste separation knowledge will moderate the
   relationship between personal norm and SAS behavior. It is expected that
   the conceptual model has a potential in helping researchers and
   stakeholders to better understand the underlying SAS behavior among
   households in Malaysia.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperspectral imaging technology is profoundly applied into the fields
   of agriculture, medicine and remote sensing due to its high spectral
   resolution, merged image-spectrum, and fast non-destructive testing.
   While the method used now has the defects of long-term testing period,
   poor efficiency and sorting asynchrony. Spectral image can identify and
   classify the target garbage by establishing a recognition and
   classification model and analyzing reflectance spectrum information
   based on the facts that different materials of domestic garbage, due to
   their different molecular structures, will absorb different wavelengths
   of light and the hyperspectral image can obtain the spatial information
   and the reflectance spectral information from different-wavelength
   illumination of the target garbage. Collected recyclable garbage samples
   of common paper, plastic and wood materials, including plastic bottles,
   food packaging bags, plastic toys (jewelry) pieces, disposable
   chopsticks, ice cream bars, wooden furniture pieces, wooden boxes, waste
   textbooks, advertising paper, office paper and other items, 30 in total.
   And cleaned and cut them to avoid the influence of sample surface stains
   on the sample reflectivity. Hyperspectral imaging systems were used to
   acquire hyperspectral images of the sample in the near-infrared (780 1
   000 nm) formed 18 training samples and 12 test samples. Pre-processed
   the collected sample image by de-noising and black-and-white correction
   inversion of reflectivity information. Then analyzed the region of
   interest of training samples by principal components analysis. The
   characteristic band extracted were 795. 815, 836. 869, 885. 619, 916.
   409, 929. 239, 934. 37, 957. 463, 972. 858, 988. 253 nm; Next, matched
   and categorized the characteristic band of the ROI with reference
   spectra of the three types of garbage from the characteristic band by
   spectral angle mapping. The result illustrated that the classification
   precision of paper (A class), plastic (B class) and wood (C class) were
   100\%, 98\% and 100\% respectively and the average was 99. 33\%; at
   last, sorted the test samples by Fisher linear discrimination. The
   classification precision of class A, B, C were 100\%, 100\% and 97\%
   respectively and the average was 99\%. After a series of testing and
   classification by SAM and Fisher as the narrated above, the results
   showed that aforesaid manipulation of hyperspectral image for recyclable
   garbage by SAM can get more accurate results which is 99. 33\%.
   meanwhile, the research can testify that it's feasible to apply the
   scheme of hyperspectral imaging to assort garbage, which is significant
   to methodically and automatically recycle garbage in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Sorting of recyclables from source-segregated municipal solid waste
   (MSW) stream is an essential step in the recycling chain in a material
   recovery facility (MRF) for waste management. Manual sorting of
   recyclables in an MRF is a highly hazardous operation for human health
   as well as time-consuming. Application of robotics for automated waste
   sorting can alleviate these problems to a large extent. The total
   sorting time depends upon the pick-and-place (PAP) sequence used in a
   robotic sorting system. In this context, the generation of optimal PAP
   sequence plan is a key challenge considering that it cannot be solved by
   an exhaustive search due to the combinatorial explosion of the search
   space. This paper reports an approach for generating optimal PAP
   sequence plan for robotic sorting of recyclables from source-segregated
   MSW stream in a system equipped with thermal-imaging technique. The PAP
   sequence generation is formulated as an optimization problem wherein the
   objective is to minimize the total sorting time. The formulated problem
   has been solved using a genetic algorithm (GA)-based approach. Numerical
   simulations as well as physical experiments using a 6 degrees-of-freedom
   (DOF) articulated manipulator have been performed to test and validate
   the developed optimal sequence generation algorithm. Results revealed an
   improvement of up to 4.28\% speedup in total sorting time over that of
   randomly generated sequences. It is envisaged that the developed
   approach can substantially improve the sorting performance in an MRF.}},

Abstract = {{This study focused on household solid-waste recycling in Da Nang city,
   Vietnam to assess the existing separation behavior and clarify the
   factors influencing the separation behavior. The authors conducted a
   questionnaire survey for 150 households in 6 urban districts, which
   consisted of household attributes, separation behavior, and the
   household's attitude on recycling and the environment. The waste
   separation rates were determined for leftover food and 13 recyclable
   items and the recyclable disposal habit was also assessed. The
   separation rate of leftover food was 77.3\%. Among 13 surveyed
   recyclable items, plastic bottles and metal cans were two popular items
   with higher separation rate (72.5\% and 63.8\%, respectively). To
   identify the conscious structure and determinants of separation
   behavior, the authors developed a predictive model on the separation
   behavior of leftover food and recyclables by logistic and multiple
   linear regression analyses. The positive factors included behavior
   intention, sympathy for the collector, incentive brought by recycling,
   goal intention, internal norm, and perception of responsibility and
   seriousness. The negative factor was evaluation of trouble. The authors
   also analyzed the differences in separation rates among attributes.
   Based on the significant influence factors and attributes, the authors
   suggested how to promote separation behavior.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of socialization, policy guidance and psychological bias
   play key roles in the recurrence of urban household waste separation

   waste separation behavior from the perspective of behavioral

   situation of fixed response validity, the effect of the interactive
   intervention can be strong, weak or negative, which correspond to
   optimal, sub-optimal and negative information intervention sets. In the
   situation of different degrees of response validity, a high degree of
   response validity leads to the fastest formation and recurrence of
   separation behavior. High degree of understanding and low degree of
   support lead to only a high individual learning rate in the initial

Abstract = {{Background: Appropriate infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices
   in the early years of life will ensure optimal growth and development of
   the child. However, many children are not fed in the recommended way.
   Objectives: To assess the risk of malnutrition as a result of various
   feeding practice patterns among the children with the application of the
   decision tree algorithm. Methods: It was a community-based
   cross-sectional study conducted in the urban slums of Berhampur
   Municipal Corporation in Ganjam District, Odisha, India, from January to
   December 2019. Among a sample of 360 children of 6-23 months,
   nutritional status and feeding practices were determined. Data were
   analyzed using R version 3.6.1 developed by R Foundation for Statistical
   Computing, Vienna, Austria. The effect of IYCF practices on nutritional
   status was explained with the decision tree method with the use of a
   Chi-squared automatic interaction detection algorithm. Results: The
   prevalence of children with early initiation of breastfeeding (EIBF),
   exclusive breastfeeding (EBF), minimum meal frequency (MMF), and minimum
   dietary diversity (MDD) was 62.2\%, 59.7\%, 41.9\%, and 19.4\%,
   respectively. The prevalence of wasting, stunting, and underweight among
   the participants was 36.4\%, 31.1\%, and 35.3\%, respectively. The
   significant factors which classified and predicted wasting were EBF,
   EIBF, and MDD, for stunting factors were EBF, MMF, and MDD and for
   underweight, significant factors were EBF, EIBF, and MDD. Conclusion:
   With the decision tree approach, the probability of malnutrition in
   relation to various feeding practices patterns can be easily explained
   to the mothers and health workers as compared to interpreting odds ratio
   and strict adherence to IYCF guidelines can also be ensured.}},

Abstract = {{With the accelerating pace of urbanization, the continuous increase of
   municipal solid waste (MSW) has become a major obstacle to China's
   economic development. Therefore, China recently regards MSW
   classification scenario as an important strategy for national ecological
   civilization. However, published references have not focused on MSW
   classification in view of environmental, economic and social acceptation
   simultaneously. This research proposes a new Decision Support System
   (DSS) model considering all three aspects to analyze the comprehensive
   benefit of the four MSW classification scenarios in Pudong (Shanghai,
   China) using cost benefit analysis (CBA), life cycle assessment (LCA)
   and analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Among them, there is an
   important boundary factor in the life cycle assessment. This work mainly
   focuses on the net energy consumption, namely the air and water emission
   of different substances. The results show that the classification
   scenario II, dividing MSW into toxic and hazardous waste, recyclable,
   kitchen waste and combustible waste, is the best option. Although
   scenario III (MSW is divided into toxic and hazardous waste, recyclable
   waste (paper, plastic, scrap metal, waste glass and other small class),
   kitchen waste and combustible wastes) and IV (recyclable waste in
   Scenario II is further classified, for example, paper is subdivided into
   newspapers, books, cardboard, etc.) further refine the MSW
   classification, the DSS model analysis results indicate that neither of
   these are the most feasible scenario. Therefore, finer classification is
   not always the better if we consider all three pillars of
   sustainability. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Metal recycling is an issue that needs attention and should be practiced
   by people as it has many advantages to human and Earth. In order to get
   a metal from Earth, the process called mining are needed where it can
   harm our natural resources due to depletion of the area to be mined. If
   the process is not controlled, most of the areas on Earth will have huge
   excavation holes. So, people should be responsible to prevent this from
   happening to preserve the environment in a good quality by recycling the
   metal material. By metal recycling, it can save an energy and resources
   as it can reduce the demand for raw materials, hence maintain the
   natural resources for the future. The proposed automatic metal waste
   separation system is intended to ease the people to separate the waste
   material. Besides, it will make the metal recycling industry work easier
   because the metal waste is already isolated at garbage collection side.
   The purpose of the project is to design a system to separate the metal
   recyclable household waste automatically and record the data waste
   collected. There are total of four detectors used to separate the
   non-metal, steel, copper and aluminum metal waste. The average time used
   to complete metal separation process by using the proposed prototype is
   14.5 seconds. This project includes a mechanical part, programming part
   and an electronic design. The system will be programmed using Arduino
   Mega as a microcontroller to control all the electronic component in the

Abstract = {{High participation rates by the public in authority projects are key in
   increasing resident recycling levels. Understanding waste separation
   behavior is crucial to achieving sustainable waste management within
   such household-based schemes. To identify the driving forces behind the
   seldom-discussed kitchen garbage separation behavior, five psychological
   factors, namely, attitude, perceived behavior control, subjective norms,
   moral norms, and responsibility denial, are established. Our data
   originate from a social study of Beijing citizens conducted in July 2013
   (n = 362). Through structural equation modeling, we find that moral
   norms are consistently the most important predictor of household kitchen
   waste (KW) separation behavior. Subjective norms have a larger effect on
   such behavior than responsibility denial. Data analysis shows that
   perceived behavior control contributes significantly and independently
   to the explanation of such behavior. By contrast, attitude towards KW
   separation is found to be significantly negatively correlated with
   separation behavior. In conclusion, the model with direct and indirect
   effects of psychological factors explains 50.3\% of the variance in
   household KW source separation behavior. Implications of the results for
   the promotion of household KW separation programs are discussed.}},

   performance are not clearly understood. The present study aims to
   address this important issue by exploring how the influence of role
   models varies with the social, economic, and demographic features of
   local residential areas. Interrupted time series analyses of monthly
   observations of public participation in a large waste sorting program in
   Hangzhou, China have been conducted to test the theoretical
   propositions. The results show that role models increased the overall
   program participation level by 5.3\%. This positive influence was
   greater in areas with stronger group cohesion, higher economic level,
   and a younger population. However, role models had a minimal effect
   among people with a low contribution predisposition. These findings
   demonstrate that the influence of role models on household recycling
   depends significantly on local contexts and personal idiosyncrasy,
   implying ways to improve the effectiveness of role model strategies in
   motivating residents' sustainable behavior. (C) 2021 Institution of

Abstract = {{Municipal solid waste is associated with different systemic challenges,
   such as climate change, resource scarcity, and ocean plastic pollution.
   European countries are striving towards more circular material use and
   the European Commission has advocated the use of economic incentives to
   boost recycling. The pay-as-you-throw (PAYT) scheme is an economic
   instrument that applies the `polluter pays' principle by charging for
   waste according to the actual amount of generated waste. Volume-based
   PAYT fees have shown to be potentially less effective in waste
   prevention and recycling than weight-based fees. This paper illustrates
   how waste management operators can price residual waste with
   weight-based fees that encourage recycling, are fair with respect to
   service levels, and cover the current income for municipal waste
   operators. The result, obtained by forming equations satisfying the
   above conditions, is a model with a linear, discrete price function,
   where the price of the residual waste generated by the citizen is a
   function of the service level. This model encourages efficient source
   separation through internal subsidies, wherein a citizen can decrease
   the price of household waste by 32\% if they increase the sorting
   efficiency from a default of 40\% to 80\% efficiency. The application of
   the model was illustrated in a case example. The model developed in this
   study can be used to implement weight-based PAYT schemes locally,
   thereby supporting the formulation of waste management systems that
   facilitate waste reduction and recycling.}},

Abstract = {{In today's fast-paced world, we are facing an escalating problem in
   ensuring efficacious and sustainable management of waste. This is a
   result of rapid increase in urbanization and industrialization. India
   ranks second in the world after China, in terms of population and this
   rising population has given way to an increase in the use of resources
   and ultimately resulting in a proportional increase in waste generation.
   The central and local governments along with the Municipal Corporations
   of our country have proposed numerous refinements regarding the manual
   management of waste. However, due to the inefficiency in the management
   of waste, environment and human health has begun to deteriorate. Thus,
   waste management has gained popularity as an issue that requires
   immediate attention and action. Waste segregation is the most important
   step in this process. This paper proposes an automated system that
   segregates waste into 6 categories based on norms accepted globally.
   This automatic waste segregator uses a modern classification method
   known as Convolutional Neural Networks to classify the waste into
   various categories. This system paves way to better recycling and reuse
   processes that helps in efficient waste management.}},

Abstract = {{A circular economy is a trendy word, which encompasses reaching of
   closed-loop in all industries. This also applies to the waste management
   sector, where new regulations and directives have been issued. Given
   milestones, however, do not have to correspond with economic or even
   environmental sustainability. Thus, it is more than necessary to
   evaluate waste management system using these criteria and present
   supportive or contradictory statements. An approach for such a complex
   assessment is proposed. It uses mathematical programming models and
   multi-objective strategy to suggest a suitable number and locations for
   waste treatment and pre-treatment facilities. Only main fractions of
   municipal solid waste are considered plastic, paper, glass and mixed
   municipal waste. The environmental part covers the production of
   greenhouse gases respecting all processes in the system, excluding
   transportation. Based on comprehensive research, non-linear dependencies
   were estimated for costs and sorting efficiencies. The mathematical
   model uses an iterative procedure to avoid non-linearity. Afterwards,
   the case study of Czech treatment infrastructure is designed. The
   approach resulted in the establishment of 14, and 42 sorting lines for
   plastics and paper, respectively, supported by 20 Waste-to-Energy plants
   with different capacity. An interesting output says that in an optimal
   situation, out of total sorted plastics and paper, only 25\% and 79\%
   will be recycled, while the remaining amount ends up in Waste-to-Energy
   plant. Further research will include additional fractions, such as
   bio-waste, oils or textile, as it is being collected these days
   separately. Other directions involve new targets from the real-operated
   sorting lines and new conditions related to investment for more
   fractions treated at a single site. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Composting can be used to reduce the volume of perishable food waste and

Abstract = {{Despite the widespread use of financial incentives to encourage public

   incentivized waste-separation programs. Generalized linear mixed model
   analyses of more than 150,000 daily participation records for residents
   in 347 housing estates in Hangzhou, China have been conducted to examine
   the theoretical propositions. The results show that substituting ingroup
   members (block leaders) for outgroup agents (company staff) as program
   advocates increased the total number of participants. However, block
   leaders contributed little or even negatively to mobilizing people who
   had never participated previously. Levels of participation were higher
   among residents with stronger social networks, but lower in communities
   with more salient volunteerism norms. These findings illuminate the
   substantial interaction between financial incentives and social

Abstract = {{Flexible and reliable probability density estimation is fundamental in
   unsupervised learning and classification. Finite Gaussian mixture models
   are commonly used for this purpose. However, the parametric form of the
   distribution is not always known. In this case, non-parametric density
   estimation methods are used. Usually, these methods become
   computationally demanding as the number of components increases. In this
   paper, a comparative study of accuracy of some nonparametric density
   estimators is made by means of simulation. The following approaches have
   been considered: an adaptive bandwidth kernel estimator, a projection
   pursuit estimator, a logspline estimator, and a k-nearest neighbor
   estimator. It was concluded that data clustering as a pre-processing
   step improves the estimation of mixture densities. However, in case data
   does not have clearly defined clusters, the pre-preprocessing step does
   not give that much of advantage. The application of density estimators
   is illustrated using municipal solid waste data collected in Kaunas
   (Lithuania). The data distribution is similar (i.e., with kurtotic
   unimodal density) to the benchmark distribution introduced by Marron and
   Wand. Based on the homogeneity tests it can be concluded that
   distributions of the municipal solid waste fractions in Kutaisi
   (Georgia), Saint-Petersburg (Russia), and Boryspil (Ukraine) are
   statistically indifferent compared to the distribution of waste
   fractions in Kaunas. The distribution of waste data collected in Kaunas
   (Lithuania) follows the general observations introduced by Marron and
   Wand (i.e., has one mode and certain kurtosis).}},

Abstract = {{The Chinese government is promoting a waste classification policy to
   solve the increasingly serious issue of cities being besieged by waste.
   Only few studies investigate whether residents' understanding of garbage
   classification policy has an impact on their garbage classification
   behaviour and the nature of such impact. The purposes of this study are
   twofold: first, to explore conceptually the mechanism behind any
   moderating effects of perceived policy effectiveness (PPE) on waste
   classification and, second, to examine empirically if and how PPE
   influences the relationships between attitude (ATT), subjective norm
   (SN), perceived behaviour control (PBC), awareness of consequence (AC)
   and waste classification intention (WCI). The conceptual model of the
   study is developed by combining insights from the theory of planned
   behaviour, norm activation theory and value-belief-norm theory. A total
   of 351 questionnaires were administered in person to households in
   Bengbu, China. The results based on structural equation modelling with
   partial least squares show that PPE negatively moderates the
   relationship between AC and WCI. AC is more strongly related with the
   intention to classify waste when PPE is weaker. Likewise, when PPE is
   higher, people's awareness of consequences becomes less important for
   WCI. The findings have significant implications in policymakers'
   developing guidelines and offer a framework for implementing more

Abstract = {{Hazardous waste management involves the collection, transportation,
   processing, recycling and disposal of industrial and domestic wastes. In
   this study, a single objective, multi-product mixed integer programming
   model for hazardous waste facility location and routing problem is
   developed for the hazardous waste management problem. The aim of the
   study is to locate hazardous waste treatment, recycling and disposal
   facilities to the designated candidate locations with the lowest cost
   and highest profit. With this, we try to ensure that the waste is
   transported between hazardous waste generation centers and these
   facilities with the minimum cost and maximum revenue. Unlike the studies
   in the literature, we constructed an enhanced model that take all the
   following properties into account: the location of hazardous waste
   treatment, recycling and disposal facilities; transportation of
   hazardous waste, hazardous recycled materials and hazardous waste
   residues between these facilities; cost, revenue, risk, capacity and
   technology compatibility. The model provides to decide the sorts of
   facilities which are needed by considering the type and amount of
   hazardous waste generated in determining where to locate these
   facilities. The model, also, determines which types of hazardous waste
   can be transported between the facilities. The developed model is
   applied to the Marmara Region with the real data provided by the
   Republic of Turkey Ministry of Environment and Urbanization.
   Accordingly, the results are evaluated and presented.}},

Abstract = {{Wadi Feiran basin is one of the most promising areas in southern Sinai
   (Egypt) for establishing new communities and for growth in agriculture,
   tourism, and industry. The present challenges against development
   include water runoff hazards (flash flooding), the increasing water
   demand, and water scarcity and contamination. These challenges could be
   mitigated by efficient use of runoff and rainwater through appropriate
   management, thereby promoting sustainable development. Strategies
   include the mitigation of runoff hazards and promoting the natural and
   artificial recharge of aquifers. This study uses a watershed modeling
   system, geographic information system, and classification scheme to
   predict the effects of various mitigation options on the basin's water
   resources. Rainwater-harvesting techniques could save more than 77\% of
   the basin's runoff (by volume), which could be used for storage and
   aquifer recharge. A guide map is provided that shows possible locations
   for the proposed mitigation options in the study basin. Appropriate
   measures should be undertaken urgently: mitigation of groundwater
   contamination (including effective sewage effluent management); regular
   monitoring of the municipal, industrial and agricultural processes that
   release contaminants; rationalization and regulation of the application
   of agro-chemicals to farmland; and regular monitoring of contaminants in
   groundwater. Stringent regulations should be implemented to prevent
   wastewater disposal to the aquifers in the study area.}},

Abstract = {{Achievement of precision measurement is highly desired in a current
   industrial revolution where a significant increase in living standards
   increased municipal solid waste. The current industry 4.0 standards
   require accurate and efficient edge computing sensors towards solid
   waste classification. Thus, if waste is not managed properly, it would
   bring about an adverse impact on health, the economy, and the global
   environment. All stakeholders need to realize their roles and
   responsibilities for solid waste generation and recycling. To ensure
   recycling can be successful, the waste should be correctly and
   efficiently separated. The performance of edge computing devices is
   directly proportional to computational complexity in the context of
   nonorganic waste classification. Existing research on waste
   classification was done using CNN architecture, e.g., AlexNet, which
   contains about 62,378,344 parameters, and over 729 million floating
   operations (FLOPs) are required to classify a single image. As a result,
   it is too heavy and not suitable for computing applications that require
   inexpensive computational complexities. This research proposes an
   enhanced lightweight deep learning model for solid waste classification
   developed using MobileNetV2, efficient for lightweight applications
   including edge computing devices and other mobile applications. The
   proposed model outperforms the existing similar models achieving an
   accuracy of 82.48\% and 83.46\% with Softmax and support vector machine
   (SVM) classifiers, respectively. Although MobileNetV2 may provide a
   lower accuracy if compared to CNN architecture which is larger and
   heavier, the accuracy is still comparable, and it is more practical for
   edge computing devices and mobile applications.}},

Abstract = {{The main aim of this study was to examine residents' environmental
   behavior in sorting solid household waste, and to identify the
   integrative factors that contribute to their waste-separation
   cooperation and other related pro-environmental behaviors. This was
   achieved based on a questionnaire survey in Shenyang, Chengdu, and
   Shanghai. Methodologically, we applied a discrete choice model to
   examine whether individuals' garbage sorting behaviors differ based on
   their characteristics, social attributes, residential circumstances, and
   environmental awareness, and whether these factors are correlated with
   individuals' receptiveness to a refuse charge system, or to policies
   requiring garbage sorting. We further examined whether individuals'
   garbage sorting behavior, their receptiveness to fee-based waste
   collection, and their receptiveness to policies requiring garbage
   sorting differ across areas. In this particular survey, we introduced a
   16 item scale of pro-environmental behavior and a nine item scale of
   altruism to ascertain the ways in which internal motivational factors
   affect people's environmentally conscious voluntary behavior. Overall,
   the present work is expected to contribute to an important understanding
   of the motivational forces and incentives behind human pro-environmental
   behavior and action. It also brings relevance to the analysis of moral
   solidarity in relation to the household waste disposal problems
   currently confronting us today.}},

Abstract = {{In South America, a high percentage of urban waste streams are not well
   managed, implying associated health and environmental risks. In Ecuador,
   around 2.7 million tons of municipal solid wastes (MSW) are generated
   annually, with 80 percent located in urban areas. Correct management and
   hygienic and ecological issues from these increased quantities of waste
   is the responsibility of municipalities that must provide sewerage,
   wastewater treatment, and solid waste management, according to the
   Constitution of the Republic (Art 264). With only seven licensed
   landfill areas out of thirty-one in total (66 percent mechanized and 34
   percent manually sorted), a sustainable waste management model must be
   developed to reduce environmental hazards and also to obtain new
   bioproducts such as compost or fertilizers. Agricultural utilization of
   MSW compost is the most cost-effective management option compared to
   traditional means such as landfilling or incineration, and this option
   also enables the recycling of potential plant nutrients. In this work,
   the problem we addressed was to obtain analytical information about
   representative MSW samples from different origins and locations within
   the Chimborazo region in order to establish its potential for
   composting. In the studied MSW samples (which included sludge from
   aerobic wastewater treatment plants), high nutrient contents and low
   concentrations of heavy metals were observed, showing great potential to
   develop high-quality compost. In addition, improvement of separate
   collections of food market and/or municipal gardening wastes can provide
   specific clean waste streams of degradable materials to be managed
   separately from not separately collected MSW.}},

   Separation Behavior of Urban and Rural Residents in China},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{An unprecedented Household Solid Waste (HSW) separation program was
   launched in 46 cities and some pilot rural areas in China in 2019. This
   study examines the antecedents of waste separation behavior using the
   extended theory of planned behavior (TPB) to identify beliefs that are
   useful targets for interventions, and compares the urban-rural
   differences. Based on interviews with rural and urban residents, we
   identified residents' beliefs influencing waste separation behaviors,
   including four behavioral, seven normative, and eight control beliefs.
   Then, we tested the conceptual model with a two-stage questionnaire
   survey using a sample of 604 residents from urban and rural areas.
   Evidence from structural equation modeling supports the extended TPB in
   that it predicts waste separation intention and behavior on the whole.
   Moral norm and self-identity were found to independently predict
   intention and may prove a useful addition to the TPB; however, the path
   from attitude to intention is not supported in both urban and rural
   models. Moreover, the specific difference of belief between urban and
   rural residents was examined. The behavioral beliefs associated to
   money, including earning, free waste bin or bag, and fine, are
   significant only in the rural group. The normative beliefs of family,
   Chinese Communist Party (CCP) members, and government can affect
   residents' subjective norm in both urban and rural, while the beliefs of
   relatives, friends, and neighbors are significant only in the rural
   group. Implications for managers of operating waste separation programs
   were discussed. Further investigation into the potential of the model to
   intervene in waste separation behavior is required.}},

Abstract = {{A techno-economic analysis of the process of producing gasoline via
   steam gasification of municipal solid waste (MSW) using dolomite
   catalysts, followed by a methanol synthesis and a methanol-to-gasoline
   process (SGMG) was conducted using an Aspen Plus model and an economic
   assessment. The process includes six steps: MSW pretreatment, steam
   gasification of MSW to produce syngas, gas purification through CO2 and
   acid gas removal, methanol synthesis using syngas, conversion of
   methanol to gasoline, and gasoline separation. The Aspen Plus model used
   to estimate the energy and mass balance for sizing the equipment assumed
   that 2000 dry metric tonnes of MSW per day would be processed. Capital
   investment required and operating costs of gasoline production were
   estimated based on the Aspen Plus model's mass and energy balance and an
   nth plant. The minimum selling price (MSP) of gasoline was calculated
   using the capital investment and operating costs of the process. The
   total capital investment of the process was estimated to be \$148
   million, with an annual operational cost of \$56 million. The minimum
   selling price was determined at \$2.40/gal for a 20-year project life.
   The sensitivity analysis showed that the cost of feedstock has a direct
   impact on the MSP of gasoline, and MSP could decrease to \$1.55/gal if
   the owners of the plant received disposal fees. Increasing the gasoline
   yield to 0.125 kg of gasoline/kg of MSW decreased the MSP to \$1.86/gal.
   The ash content in MSW played a vital role in estimating the MSP. If the
   ash content in the feedstock increased, the MSP increased owing to a
   decrease in the gasoline yield and an increase in the cost of
   operations.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The aim of this paper is to examine the motives behind the
   separation of household waste (or the lack of such separation) on the

   to broaden and deepen the understanding of key determinants of household
   waste separation (or the lack of such separation). This study proposes a
   conceptual model based on the theory of interpersonal behaviour in
   combination with the focus theory of normative conduct.
   Design/methodology/approach A quantitative method was applied to
   investigate the views of 350 heads of households in the Johannesburg
   metropolitan area through an administered questionnaire. Structural
   equation modelling was employed to test the hypothesised structural
   relationships in the proposed model. Findings The results indicate that
   household waste separation intention is influenced by cognition of the
   consequences and by injunctive and personal normative pressures.
   Separation intention and past habits were found to have a direct
   influence on actual separation behaviour. Originality/value While the
   theory of planned behaviour is ubiquitous in the recycling literature,
   this study presents a different, broader framework for a better
   understanding of the drivers of household waste separation. This is
   achieved by applying the theory of interpersonal behaviour in
   combination with the focus theory of normative conduct. The findings
   provide insights that could help municipalities in emerging markets to

   a survey of environmental protection data in Chengyang District, Qingdao
   City. Then, after clarifying the composition and quantity of domestic
   waste (recyclable waste, kitchen waste and corresponding hazardous
   waste) under the premise of a strong economy in the study area, a
   three-level model consisting of wastewater, waste gas, and waste residue
   was sorted out. Furthermore, the unsupervised mathematical modeling was
   carried out using the analytic hierarchy process. The study concluded
   that the weight of the intermediate layer under the jurisdiction of the
   study area is ranked as follows: waste residue>waste water>exhaust gas,
   and the weight of waste residue is as high as 0.625 0, which is much
   larger than other intermediate layer factors. Therefore, it is
   determined that special rectification of waste residues is required in
   this area. The order of weight of the schemes under the jurisdiction of
   the study area is: soil modification> sharp decline of biological
   species> pathogen transmission> acid rain pollution> climate warming,
   ozone layer destruction. The calculation results of the weights of the
   scheme layer show that the weights are not much different. The largest
   is the impact of soil modification (0.489 2), and the smallest is the
   impact of climate warming and ozone layer destruction (0.047 8).

Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{701-710}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The environmental impacts from three management alternatives for organic
   fraction of municipal solid waste were compared using lifecycle
   assessment methodology. The alternatives (sanitary landfill, selective
   collection of organic waste for anaerobic digestion and anaerobic
   digestion after post-separation of organic waste) were modelled applying
   an attributional as well as consequential approach, in parallel with the
   aim of identifying if and how these approaches can affect results and
   conclusions. The marginal processes identified in the consequential
   modelling were in general associated with higher environmental impacts
   than average processes modelled with an attributional approach. As all
   investigated waste management alternatives result in net-substitution of
   energy and in some cases also materials, the consequential modelling
   resulted in lower absolute environmental impacts in five of the seven
   environmental impact categories assessed in the study. In three of
   these, the chosen modelling approach can alter the hierarchy between
   compared waste management alternatives. This indicates a risk of
   underestimating potential benefits from efficient energy recovery from
   waste when applying attributional modelling in contexts in which
   electricity provision historically has been dominated by technologies
   presenting rather low environmental impacts, but where projections point
   at increasing impacts from electricity provision in coming years. Thus,
   in the present case study, the chosen approach affects both absolute and
   relative results from the comparison. However, results were largely
   related to the processes identified as affected by investigated changes,
   and not merely the chosen modelling approach. The processes actually
   affected by future choices between different waste management
   alternatives are intrinsically uncertain. The study demonstrates the
   benefits of applying different assumptions regarding the processes
   affected by investigated choices both for provision of energy and
   materials substituted by waste management processes in consequential LCA
   modelling, in order to present outcomes that are relevant as decision
   support within the waste management sector. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{259}},
Month = {{JUN 20}},
Abstract = {{Implementing circular business models in food supply chains is an
   organizational solution to tackle the issue of household food waste,
   converting it in feedstock to upcycle within industrial symbioses.
   Adopting literature on practices of food consumption as theoretical
   framework, this paper analyzes consumers' participation in circular
   business models. A conceptual model of the emergence of food
   provisioning practices in circular business models is designed and
   empirically tested, through a survey, in order to analyze consumers'
   willingness to participate in an innovative food provisioning mechanism
   with retailers. Respondents were asked to choose whether to participate
   or not in a proposed program, and their choices have been modelled in an
   ordered logit model. 88\% of interviewees declared sorting organic food
   waste as a normal activity in his household. 78.9\% of participants
   accepted to participate to the proposed programs independently of the
   type of agreement's attributes. 14.49\% accepted only some programs
   depending on the program type, while 6.61\% of respondents choose not to
   participate to any of the proposed program. Findings outline the
   expected participant as an individual already engaged in tasks to cope
   with risk in food provisioning and having already developed a
   long-lasting relation with a retailer. The study reveals also the
   opposite effect of concerns about tasks related to take-back system,
   such as food waste handling, and social desirability of recycling.
   Focusing on the business-to-consumers relationship, the paper suggests
   to practitioners interested in circular business models the possibility
   to adopt innovative `food-product-as-a-service' approaches.
   Recommendations can be derived for future studies about the relevance of
   practice theory in the analysis of consumers' engagement in circular
   business models. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Innovative and efficient use of municipal solid waste as a source of
   energy is an important way to promote the transition to low-carbon
   cities. One key strategy to improve energy efficiency is to create a
   network of multiple sectors that can produce and utilize energy from
   waste. This mechanism has already been adopted at the urban scale in
   several developed countries as a way to enhance environmental efficiency
   and reduce adverse impacts. However, to use waste efficiently, it is
   necessary to examine the supply chain of wastes as a source of materials
   with potential to generate energy. Such an examination can inform the
   design of an efficient waste-to-energy process that will create a
   symbiosis between industry and the waste management sector. In this
   paper, we describe a model that evaluates energy recovery efficiency by
   considering the costs and benefits of an innovative waste-to-energy
   system. In the model, we also consider the material and energy flow of
   wastes in accordance with the quantity and quality of waste emissions,
   the separation system, treatment technologies and combinations thereof,
   and energy recovery and use in other sectors. The scenario was designed
   by identifying waste management options, including waste
   quantity/quality; the separation system; the treatment technology model
   for wet or dry methane fermentation; incineration; a combined system
   that involves superheating with exchanging heat between the incineration
   plant and fermenter; and use of refuse paper and plastic fuel (RPF). The
   results revealed that energy recovery efficiency was most dependent on
   the effective use of RPF with a relatively high lower heating value and
   superheating of boiler steam by methane gas in the combined system. An
   important conclusion was that the most efficient system was a combined
   system in which paper, plastic, and RPF were separated from 80\% of the
   waste, and 20\% of the waste was incinerated and used for wet methane
   fermentation. The amounts of energy recovered from that system was 54.5
   kWh/t, and the efficiency was 33.4\%. Analytical results indicated that
   it is possible to create the critical technology and to develop policy
   insights needed to make efficient waste management systems for the
   transition to low-carbon cities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A smart city (SC) is a sustainable and efficient urban center that
   provides a high quality of life to its inhabitants through optimal
   management of its resources that nowadays have been wider and wider. In
   modern societies, municipal solid waste management (MSWM) is an
   important part of SCs, the main problem of MSWM is the cost that it
   generates and must be reduced. To solve this situation in this paper are
   considered two sub-models. The first sub-model uses vehicle routing
   problem (VRP) for routing fleet among generation waste to separation
   facilities. The second sub-model is designed to allocate resources from
   separation facilities to set of recovery plants or landfill centers.
   From the best of our knowledge, most of the past studies related to this
   topic have focused only on deterministic implementations. Also, recent
   studies usually focus on uncertain parameters in the area of waste
   generation. In addition, a few related studies have developed the
   uncertain parameter which has focused on facilitating separation. This
   study considers the uncertain parameters in the output rate of
   separation facilities as well as the importance of value recovery from
   each bin; the aim is to enhance the efficiency of operations. The
   purpose of this study is to minimize the total transportation cost and
   to maximize recycled revenue. Chance-constrained programming has been
   used to deal with stochastic optimization model. Four metaheuristic
   algorithms are employed to identify the best solution. Besides, the
   performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated. Finally,
   sensitivity analyses along with number of scenarios have developed to
   measure the tightness of the proposed problem. The results of the study
   illustrate the optimized number of vehicles that can help the managers
   and decision-makers in various tightness conditions.}},

   Comparison of two collection systems},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{304}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{In circular bioeconomy, biowaste has a great potential for utilization
   as organic fertilizer. This study aims to evaluate the probability of
   anaerobically digested biowaste to qualify as organic fertilizer, within
   the framework of the EU fertilizer Regulation. The parameters
   investigated are the heavy metal and nutrient content of the solid and
   liquid fertilizers, and soil improvers. Two collection systems for the
   organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) are assessed, i.e.,
   source-separation (SS) and mechanical separation (MS) from unsorted
   waste. A modelling tool is developed for calculating the quality of the
   digestate, purposed as organic fertilizer, based on feedstock data. Four
   scenarios of biogas production efficiencies are modelled (60\%, 70\%,
   80\%, and 90\% of volatile solids removal) to cover the different
   anaerobic digestion configurations. A Monte Carlo simulation is applied
   to estimate the probability of exceeding the regulatory limits for heavy
   metal concentration in organic fertilizers. The statistical analysis of
   the biowaste illustrates that the quality of the SS-OFMSW is higher than
   the MS-OFMSW. The Monte Carlo simulation shows that the SS-OFMSW
   digestate has 18\% probability of exceeding the regulatory limit value
   for Cadmium and less than 10\% for the rest of the heavy metals. The
   MS-OFMSW digestate illustrates a higher risk that ranges from 11\% to
   51\%. The study justifies the explicit exclusion of the MS-OFMSW from
   the positive list of inputs for the production of organic fertilizers in
   the circular economy market. High quality organic fertilizers can
   contribute to closing the nutrient loop by returning them on
   agricultural soil while safeguarding soil health and food safety. (c)

Abstract = {{In urban households such as houses and condominiums in the city, there
   are a lot of cases where people waste huge amount of clean water in
   irrigating plants. Siling Labuyo is a common spice in the Philippines
   and apparently, birds are one of the few who can eat Siling Labuyo
   Peppers in urban areas. This paper tackles the use of a Raspberry Pi
   model 3B+ to control an automated irrigation system with a bird
   deterrent system. The irrigation system is based on evapotranspiration
   referenced by the Penman-Monteith equation. It estimates the net
   evapotranspiration using solar radiation, temperature, humidity, and
   wind speed as parameters. It aims to determine the significance of the
   system when it comes to the total number of fruits produced per plant in
   a span of 6 weeks. Image processing was used for the bird detection,
   Opencv was used for object detection, using a trained Haar cascade model
   in order to detect birds. While a rotating red light was used for the
   bird deterrence. The Raspberry Pi controls the water flow for the
   irrigation system and the switching of the light for the bird deterrent
   system. This paper concludes that: the ET-based irrigation system does
   not affect the number of fruits produced by the plant as compared to the
   usage of the traditional irrigation system, the ET-based irrigation
   system saved 15931.7238 mL of water compared to the traditional
   irrigation system, and the rotating red light was an effective way to
   deter the Eurasian tree sparrow ``Maya{''} birds.}},

Title = {Using convolutional neural networks to classify the maturity of compost
   based on sewage sludge and rapeseed straw},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{258}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{Large amounts of municipal sewage sludge are generated every year.
   Composting is one of the most popular and cost-effective methods of
   handling this waste. It is particularly important to carry out the
   composting of sewage sludge in an efficient way. The identification of
   the stage of early maturity of composted material is crucial. The
   objective of this study was to check the possibility of using
   convolutional neural networks to classify the early maturity of compost
   made from sewage sludge and rapeseed straw. The literature review showed
   that this specific and modern type of neural network had not been
   investigated for this purpose before. A mixture of these two substrates,
   composted for 25 days in 7 experiments, was the research material.
   Images of the material samples were acquired in a dedicated photo
   station illuminated with: visible light, ultraviolet light, and mixed
   visible and ultraviolet light. For each acquisition variant 1312 images
   were obtained. On the basis of the acquired images, 25 convolutional
   neural networks with one convolutional layer and a varied number of
   convolution filters were developed to determine the stage of early
   maturity of the material. Their classification error ranged from 0.51\%
   to 17.77\%. The best classification result was obtained for the model
   containing 16 convolution filters and based on images of the material
   acquired in mixed visible and ultraviolet light. The results presented
   in this paper have shown that convolutional neural networks are an
   adequate tool to assess compost maturity. Such models may provide a
   simplified and cost-effective approach to the approximate evaluation of
   the early maturity of compost. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by

Title = {GIS application for urban domestic wastewater treatment site selection
   in the Northern Ethiopia, Tigray Regional State: a case study in Mekelle
   City},
Journal = {ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES},

Abstract = {{Mekelle City is among the most rapidly growing cities in Ethiopia though
   the management of wastewater is very poor. The city lacks proper
   infrastructures for the collection and treatment of urban wastewater so
   that the wastewater released from different sectors directly joins the
   urban drainage of the city that finally flows to the Ellala River, which
   crosses the city. However, such practices have the potential to
   contaminate water reservoirs and surface water and groundwater bodies
   that endangers the health of the nearby society. Hence, to reduce and
   manage the wastewater impact sustainably, introducing natural treatment
   mechanisms like waste stabilization pond technology (WSP) is an ultimate
   means to implement with low cost and technology demand. Hence, the
   objective of this study was to select suitable sites for WSP sites to
   treat domestic wastewater of the city. During the process of WSP
   selection, nine most important parameters were considered namely
   groundwater, hydrogeology, slope, elevation, soil depth, land use land
   cover (LULC), distance from the settlement, from the road, and from the
   river. Those determinant factors affecting site selection were generated
   from satellite images, maps, and Digital Elevation Model. Supervised
   image classification for Landsat TM satellite image was done while the
   rest variables' geo-database files were generated in ArcGIS interface
   software. Since all input variables have not equal influence in WSP site
   selection, the weighted value of variable estimation was undertaken
   using the algorism weighted combination formula. And finally, the
   weighted overlay model was used to run the model so that suitable sites
   were selected. Result shows that the city has a large number of
   alternative sites for establishing a waste stabilization pond. Five
   classes of suitability were generated (from low to very high suitability
   level). The North West and Northern parts of the city are found in the
   potential candidates' areas as of the central and southern parts.
   Geographically, these areas are topographically gentle slope and have
   low altitude plus the newly designed sewer line network outlet lies in
   this direction. In contrast, unsuitable areas are found in the East,
   Central, and South direction of the study area. These selected areas are
   characterized by high population density, steep slope, and high
   topography. Groundwater, elevation, hydrogeology, and slope were found
   the most influential parameters determining WSP site selection. On the
   other hand, distance from road and river, land use cover, and soil depth
   were found the least influential parameters that determine WSP
   selection. Out of the total mml area, 21.3\% were found highly suitable.
   So, this implies that the city has a large potential area that can be
   used for WSP establishment. From the present study, it can be concluded
   that GIS is a very essential tool in urban utility establishment like
   urban domestic wastewater treatment site selection. Although the city
   has adequate potential areas for establishing WSP, further assessment of
   flood vulnerability, biochemical determination, wastewater amount
   quantification, population growth, and urban expansion need to be
   seriously considered before implementing.}},
