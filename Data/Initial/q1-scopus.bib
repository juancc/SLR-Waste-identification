abstract={Municipal solid waste (MSW) properties and parameters for MSW treatment technologies are decisive for GHG emission of MSW treatment systems. But they are changing in China due to MSW source segregation and technological advancements, which requires new studies on GHG emissions of MSW treatment systems based on up-to-date data. In this study, GHG emission values and their uncertainties of waste treatment systems before and after MSW source segregation in Shanghai were analyzed utilizing Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methods and Monte Carlo analysis. The results showed that before waste segregation, 21.0∼319 kg CO2-eq GHG per tonne was emitted and that -139∼203 kg CO2-eq GHG per tonne was emitted after waste source segregation. The source segregation helps to reduce GHG emissions from MSW treatment systems. In the long run, waste to energy incineration was not recommended from GHG perspective and anaerobic digestion has a great potential for GHG emission reductions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Waste sorting is highly labor intensive because the wide variety of waste items prohibits automation. More recently, deep learning (DL) and computer vision technology has presented an opportunity to streamline the sorting process, but many important developmental steps remain. If computer vision technology can increase the efficiency of automated waste sorting, this would be beneficial for society and the environment. Accordingly, this study used the You Only Look Once-v3 (Yolo-v3) detection model based on DL to enhance recognition performance of household waste products. TrashNet, a commonly used waste image database, was used to train an initial Yolo-v3 model, however each image used for training only had a single waste object, and this study found that the detection model trained with a single object dataset was not only unsuitable for sorting multiple waste objects, but that this has rarely been addressed in academic literature. It was also discovered that nations and regions will need to develop their own unique databases that reflect the types of waste products found. Samples images need to account for the various appearances and colors and be combined in multiple waste object images when training the system. This paper documents the training and testing of an object detection model suitable for detecting domestic waste specific to Taiwan; however, the approach taken would be of use to other countries seeking to automate waste sorting. To achieve this, it was necessary to compile the Taiwan Recycled Waste Database (TRWD). This was then used to train the Yolo-v3, and the efficiencies of this, versus the standard TrashNet model were compared. Results showed that the TRWD-trained Yolo-v3 achieved mAP@0.5 of 92.12% and could detect waste in real-time. Relative to the TrashNet-trained Yolo-v3, the TRWD counterpart performed better due to the multiple waste objects and more relevant image repository. Further studies are recommended to investigate the effect of combining additional sensors that would enable improved detection of specific wastes. Combining the TRWD-trained Yolo-v3 with a robot system for waste sorting would potentially be another rewarding avenue of research. © 2022},

abstract={1. The properties of plastics make them highly useful for various purposes in modern life. But the impact of waste produced from the same is raising serious environmental concerns because most of the plastic in use are non-biodegradable. Though there are attempts to develop plastics that are eco-friendly, the production of the same is in the initial stages only. There is thus an urgent need for efficient methods for retrieval and reprocessing of different plastic types from the domestic and industrial waste to be recycled for further use. This review focuses on four major spectroscopic methods, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), Laser Induced Fluorescence spectroscopy (LIF), and Raman spectroscopy, highly suitable for the plastic identification and sorting because of their speed, specificity and need of only minimal human involvement for routine use. The present status of the application of these spectroscopic methods and their scope in developing an industry-oriented plastic sorting system for recycling of plastic waste is discussed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Urban symbiosis (UrS) is an innovative application of circular economy focusing on municipal solid waste (MSW). However, few studies have been conducted to forecast the impact of UrS on climate change under different MSW sorting policies such as four-category/two-category MSW separation standards and high/low sorting rates from a long-term and dynamic perspective. This study develops a system dynamics model to simulate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction potential and the energy saving potential of UrS under different MSW sorting modes in Shanghai for the period of 2020–2050. The results show that UrS with four-category MSW separation and a high sorting rate (scenario S1) has the highest energy saving and GHG reduction potential at both annual level and accumulative level, approximately 10.75 times the energy saving and 146.30% of the GHG emission reduction compared with the Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario in 2050. Meanwhile, the scenario of two-category MSW sorting and a high sorting rate (S3) can further help reduce 12.84% GHG emissions than the scenario of four-category MSW sorting and low sorting rates (S2) in 2050. Among all the UrS measures, waste plastic recovery can contribute the most GHG emission and energy consumption reductions, with figures of approximately 2.15 Mt and 17.28 Mtce, respectively. Finally, policy recommendations on strengthening implementation of four-category MSW separation, making efficient two-category MSW separation as a backup plan, and promoting reutilization of waste plastic and Refuse Plastic & Paper Fuel technology are proposed. © 2021},

abstract={Garbage classification technology is not only an important basis for the harmless treatment of waste and resource recovery, but also the inevitable trend of social development. The current garbage classification methods rely on manual classification in the garbage collection stage, and it is difficult to achieve satisfying results in consistency, stability, and sanitary conditions. For this reason, this study designs and develops a garbage classification system based on deep learning that can recognize and recycle domestic garbage. Focusing on the problems of low accuracy and poor real-time performance, a lightweight garbage classification model GCNet (Garbage Classification Network) is proposed. GCNet contains three improvements on ShuffleNet v2, including the design of parallel mixed attention mechanism (PMAM), the use of new activation functions, and transfer learning. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of GCNet on the self-built dataset is 97.9%, the amount of model parameters is only 1.3M, the single inference time on Raspberry Pi 4B is about 105ms, and the classification system needs only 0.88 seconds to complete the classification and collection of a single object. The method proposed in this paper is an effective attempt at machine vision in garbage classification and resource recovery. With the improvement of technology, it will effectively promote academic exploration and engineering application in the field of resources and environment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In recent years, the production of municipal solid waste has constantly been increasing. Recycling is becoming more and more important, as it is the only way that we can have a clean and sustainable environment. Recycling, however, is a process that is not fully automated; large volumes of waste materials need to be processed manually. New and novel techniques have to be implemented in order to manage the increased volume of waste materials at recycling factories. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology that can identify common waste materials as they are being processed on a moving belt in waste collection facilities. An efficient waste material detection and classification system is proposed, which can be used in real integrated solid waste management systems. This system is based on a convolutional neural network and is trained using a custom dataset of images, taken on site from actual moving belts in waste collection facilities. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system can outperform existing algorithms found in the literature in real-world conditions, with 92.43% accuracy. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={The accelerated modern day urban development is accompanied by an increasing production of solid waste. While managing solid waste on an industrial scale presents different technological challenges, managing household waste requires decentralized solutions dealing with the associated logistic and technical difficulties. In this review, we identify the research trends on household waste recycling by providing a brief description of the main technologies, and the traditional formats commonly used for solid waste (SW) separation. We identify two main threads: the SW management systems within a smart city framework and the design of domestic waste classification systems based on intelligent mechanisms tailored to user psychology. Among the main conclusions, we verify a growing interest in the subject of SW separation in domestic applications, mainly through solutions based on automation and internet of things (IoT). Also, we detected a increasing interest in the analysis of psychological aspects and in citizen education in relation to the importance of recycling, since without this notion the success of proposed solutions might be limited. © 2022, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

abstract={Hydrogen chloride (HCl) monitoring during combustion/gasification of biomass fuels and municipal solid waste, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and food residues, is demanded to avoid the adverse effect of HCl to furnace operation and to improve the quality of the gas products. Infrared tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (IR-TDLAS) is a feasible nonintrusive in-situ method for HCl measurements in harsh environments. In the present work, the measurement was performed using the R(3) line of the ν2 vibrational band of HCl at 5739.25 cm–1 (1742.4 nm). Water vapor is ubiquitous in combustion/gasification environments, and its spectral interference is one of the most common challenges for IR-TDLAS. Spectral analysis based on the current well-known databases was found to be insufficient to achieve an accurate measurement. The lack of accurate temperature-dependent water spectra can introduce thousands parts per million (ppm) HCl overestimation. For the first time, accurate spectroscopic data of temperature-dependent water spectra near 5739.3 cm–1 were obtained based on a systematic experimental investigation of the hot water lines in a well-controlled, hot flue gas with a temperature varying from 1100 to 1950 K. With the accurate knowledge of hot water interference, the HCl TDLAS system can achieve a detection limit of about 100 ppm⋅m at around 1500 K, and simultaneously the gas temperature can be derived. The technique was applied to measure the temporally resolved HCl release and local temperature over burning PVC particles in hot flue gas at 1790 K. © The Author(s) 2022.},

Since the detection of active pharmaceutical waste in the landfill soils and waters, several policy changes have been implemented. Most of the pharmaceutical waste is gathered from households, thus probably a new recycling policy should be implemented. This paper aims to prevent the pharmaceutical waste from getting into the soil by sorting any incoming pills in different categories so these can be disposed of properly without the risk of contaminants getting in the environment. The pills sorting system uses a machine vision based system. Pills are put on a conveyor belt which transports them through the sorting area. Pills images are analyzed and consequently they will be placed into different bins with the help of multiple palettes driven by stepper motors. This method ensures an efficient solution that could be implemented in any landfill sorting station. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={One of the recent problems on waste sorting systems is their performance evaluation for proper decision making and management. For this purpose, multi-criteria methods can be used to evaluate the sorting system from both operational and financial perspectives. According to a recent literature review, there are no solutions for evaluating waste sorting systems that take into account: sorting point utilisation, sorting efficiency, waste stream irregularity, and technical system availability. In addition, the problem of data uncertainty and the need to use expert judgements indicate the need for the implementation of methods adjusted to the qualitative and quantitative assessment, such as the fuzzy approach. Following this, in order to overcome the presented limitations, the authors introduced the new assessment method for waste sorting systems based on multi-criteria model implementation and fuzzy theory use. Therefore, the developed model was based on a hierarchical fuzzy logic model for which appropriate membership function parameters and inference rules were defined. The specificity of the chosen assessment criteria and their justification was provided. The model has been implemented to evaluate one of the waste sorting plants in Wroclaw, Poland. Tests have been conducted for seven different configurations of waste sorting lines (with variable input parameters). The study focuses on analysing the amount of selected waste at each station in relation to the total stream size of each fraction. Efficiency was measured by the mass of the collected waste and the number of pieces of waste in each fraction. Based on the obtained results, estimations of particular parameters of the model were made, and the results were presented and commented on. It was shown that there is a significant relationship between the level of system evaluation and sorting efficiency and an inverse relationship with the level of RDF obtained. The analysis was based on Pearson’s linear correlation coefficient estimation and linear regression implementation. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Domestic waste classification was incorporated into legal provisions recently in China. However, relying on manpower to detect and classify domestic waste is highly inefficient. To that end, in this article, we propose a multimodel cascaded convolutional neural network (MCCNN) for domestic waste image detection and classification. MCCNN combined three subnetworks (DSSD, YOLOv4, and Faster-RCNN) to obtain the detections. Moreover, to suppress the false-positive predicts, we utilized a classification model cascaded with the detection part to judge whether the detection results are correct. To train and evaluate MCCNN, we designed a large-scale waste image dataset (LSWID), containing 30 000 domestic waste multilabeled images with 52 categories. To the best of our knowledge, the LSWID is the largest dataset on domestic waste images. Furthermore, a smart trash can is designed and applied to a Shanghai community, which helped to make waste recycling more efficient.

abstract={The research focuses on complex comparative evaluation of environmental efficiency of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) treatment scenarios that can be implemented in St. Petersburg and Leningradskaya oblast'. Three scenarios were modelled that technically and economically meet the regional needs. The scenarios imply the following systems: 1) sorting, Mechanical-Biological Treatment (MBT), landfilling; 2) sorting, MBT, Waste-to-Energy (WTE), landfilling; 3) sorting, MBT, Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) for cement industry, landfilling. In comparison, the "zero"scenario implying landfilling untreated waste was modelled. A Life Cycle Assessment based approach was proposed, which allows comparing scenarios through converting heterogeneous impact categories to a single monetary index. The highest damage reduction (by 60-70% in comparison with the "zero"scenario) was shown in the complex scenarios, including both MBT and energy recovery. 40, 42 and 47% of the total damage in scenarios 1, 2, 3 accordingly is associated with MBT product landfilling. The results show that the main benefit of complex treatment cannot be fully realized without separate collection of food waste. In this situation the most environmentally soundable scenario comprises recyclables separation and subsequent WTE treatment of all the rest with the exception of some non-combustibles. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={A statistical analysis of information about fires that occurred on the railroads shows that it is necessary to enhance the fire protection measures while transporting the fire-hazardous materials (FHM). A comparative analysis of the use of the exergetic index and the flammability potential for forecasting the fire risks connected to the railroad FHM transportation has been performed. The studies considered municipal solid waste (MSW) as promising railway cargo. The values of the MSW chemical exergy and the heat of combustion have been calculated. The conditions and behavior of their variations have been investigated. A system of the substances and materials classification that is based on the exergetic coefficient was introduced. The proposed approach allows us to resolve methodological problems caused by the requirement to account for the technical, economical criteria, and the fire risk indexes into a unified classification system. The conception of the exergetic index improves the objectivity of the procedure for the estimation of the MSW flammability properties. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Municipal solid waste (MSW) management has become a problem in China, mainly since there is no uniform standard for MSW management charges, causing conflict between local residents and the government. An intelligent garbage sorting system (IGSS) is an effective sorting approach for MSW management. To explore the predictors of local residents’ willingness to pay (WTP) for the IGSS, this study applied an extended theory of planned behavior (TPB) model by adding an antecedent environmental concern (EC) prior to the main predictors of the TPB model (attitudes, subject norms, perceived behavioral control). The WTP of Beijing residents for MSW management and the determinants of WTP were analyzed. The specific amount of WTP was predicted by a contingent valuation method (CVM) in an online questionnaire, and the mean WTP was estimated to be USD 49.93 per household per year. The results showed a positive connection between EC and residents’ WTP, and most of the participants were willing to pay for the IGSS for MSW management. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The rapidly growing output of solid waste has brought tremendous pressure to urban development. China launched an action plan known as “Zero-waste city” (ZWC), that refers to an urban development model aimed at reducing the generation of and enhancing the recycling of solid waste, in order to alleviate environmental impacts. Eleven cities and five special zones achieved positive results of solid waste management were selected as pilot areas for exploring empirical methods until 2019. The practices and lessons of the pilot cities need to be deeply analyzed and summarized, so as to promote successful models, learn lessons and better implement the policy com-prehensively for other cities. This study presents a review of China’s ZWC policies and practices with constructive suggestions for further development. Based on the policy objective of ZWC and the field investigation of solid waste flow, five crucial approaches to developing ZWC are proposed, namely, solid waste reduction throughout the industrial chain, collaborative treatment of classified municipal solid waste (MSW), efficient utilization of agricultural waste with multiple purposes, safety control of hazardous waste flow, and optimization of market mechanisms. The case study demonstrates that the five paths are appropriate to Xuzhou city. However, deficiencies in MSW classification, pesticide packaging waste collection systems, solid waste product application, management, and policymaking, have emerged. Regulatory prohibitions, extended producer responsibility and market vitality should be adopted to improve the collection, transportation, and utilization of solid waste. Key findings from this research are to summarize crucial paths toward fulfiling ZWC goal, and to reveal some successful practices of, and lessons from ZWC construction by case studies. This study provides a method to further implement zero solid waste management in a targeted manner. The recommendations drawn from the study, which include law, market and institutional measures, may contribute to the achievement of developing sustainable cities. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Effective waste administration is one of the major environmental issues of the present time. The isolation, taking care of, transportation and transfer of waste is to be appropriately overseen in order to limit the hazard to nature. The efficient estimation of waste is best acknowledged when it is isolated. The customary method for physically isolating the waste uses exertion that is more human, time and cost. This work proposes a waste tracking system with integrated waste sorting mechanism, which is an easy and economical way to segregate and track domestic waste. It is intended to sort the domestic waste into metallic, plastic and glass categories. After segregation, the tracking system informs the server how much waste each household is producing. Along these lines, a successful framework for waste management is made helpful for recycling procedures for better environmental cleaning ecosystem with proper waste management operations. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={S city in China has implemented a waste classification system and constructed a waste classification model with government-led market and public participation. In order to explore the effectiveness of waste classification input in S city, this paper conducts analyses from the points of view of the classification facility’s construction, environmental effectiveness, social acceptability and operation sustainability, based on interviews with and questionnaire surveys completed by related parties. The results show that the current waste classification facility system in S city is basically completed; high rates of both properties and residents comply with the waste classification system. S city has established a government-led waste classification pattern that depends on social participation. This pattern has been recognized and accepted by residents and is economically sustainable. At the same time, it is pointed out that the current marginal effectiveness of the waste classification input is showing a declining trend. Future investment should shift from investment in facilities and equipment to incentives for autonomous management by residents, and the corresponding evaluation of investment and effectiveness should also change accordingly. This requires the government to guide the refined management system. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={A proof-of-concept municipal waste management system was proposed to reduce the cost of waste classification, monitoring and collection. In this system, we utilize the deep learning-based classifier and cloud computing technique to realize high accuracy waste classification at the beginning of garbage collection. To facilitate the subsequent waste disposal, we subdivide recyclable waste into plastic, glass, paper or cardboard, metal, fabric and the other recyclable waste, a total of six categories. Deep-learning convolution neural networks (CNN) were applied to realize the garbage classification task. Here, we investigate seven state-of-the-art CNNs and data pre-processing methods for waste classification, whose accuracies of nine categories range from 91.9 to 94.6% in the validation set. Among these networks, MobileNetV3 has a high classification accuracy (94.26%), a small storage size (49.5 MB) and the shortest running time (261.7 ms). Moreover, the Internet of Things (IoT) devices which implement information exchange between waste containers and waste management center are designed to monitor the overall amount of waste produced in this area and the operating state of any waste container via a set of sensors. According to monitoring information, the waste management center can schedule adaptive equipment deployment and maintenance, waste collection and vehicle routing plans, which serves as an essential part of a successful municipal waste management system. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Seeing that Shanghai implemented mandatory household waste sorting system (referred as Shanghai Model) in 2019 and achieved remarkable improvements, the study focuses on how to localize it in second-tier cities. Specifically, by applying system dynamics method, a qualitative Basic Model and a quantitative Shanghai Model simulating residents’ waste related behavior are built. Combined Theory of Planned Behavior and the Split-Core Model are adopted. Data of Zhengzhou is inputted and simulated to representatively deliver policy implications to second-tier cities. The result shows that improving transactional context can lift the weight of willingness and depress the weight of opportunism in behavior decision makings. Shanghai Model significantly improves the legal transaction context of waste sorting which make residents actively sort the wastes under the promotion of willingness. For second-tier cities of China, improving transactional context to reduce opportunism and conquering the short board of willingness to promote active participation are indispensable. And, waste reducing measures like the unit pricing system are recommended to make up the shortage of the Shanghai Model. The study puts forward a synthetic analyzing framework of waste related behaviors and builds a portable policy analyzing system of waste management for both China and other developing countries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={ABSTARCT: The worldwide energy demand still increases along with civilization development. The energy is prevalently acquired from fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas), whose reserves are being slowly used up, or whose utilization has detrimental effect on environment. This is why the renewable energy sources (RES) are gaining an increasing share in energy production, while their utilization will not lead to their scarcity in a long-term perspective, as the resources are renewed in the short-term perspective. Moreover, their negative environmental influence is insignificant. The sun, wind and water, and sometimes geothermal power, are the prevalent sources of renewable energy. Also landfill gas, generated on waste dumps can be utilized as a renewable energy source. Biogas (the landfill gas) is combustible gas belonging to RESs, which is produced from biomass by the process of anaerobic digestion of organic matter. Its main constituents are methane and carbon dioxide. In order to enable utilisation of biogas from landfill, the latter should be equipped with biogas receiving system: the wells together with piping system, which will be responsible for biogas collecting. The methane share in landfill gas varies, depending on contents and composition of organic fraction, but usually it ranges within 40–60%. In order to assist landfill gas production, optimal condition for methane-genesis process should be created within the mass of wastes. Compacting wastes or laying soil layers in-between them can serve as examples. Both processes result in lowering oxygen contents in the wastes. It is, however, the organic fraction content in the landfilled waste that has the greatest impact on biogas production. Following the introduction of waste segregation system, the volume of organic waste landfilled has significantly decreased, thus decreasing the potential of landfills as a source of biogas. The article presents the results of research carried out at an active, municipal waste landfills. The measurements were performed in five degassing wells, located in various parts of the landfill. The research demonstrated that the wells located in the central part of the landfill, which were properly preserved and located within wastes having high organic fraction content, show biogas flow at a good level. © 2021, Oil and Gas Institute – National Research Institute.

abstract={Despite technological advances in waste recycling and management, many developing countries, including Iran, are still in the early stages of this process: the segregation and collection of recyclable waste. In this regard, to increase citizens' coope ration in household waste segregation, a rewarding solid-waste collection system has been established in the metropolises of Iran. In such circumstances, it is evident that maintaining the continued use of citizens without compromising their satisfaction has become an essential concern in the development of a sustainable waste collection and recycling system in Iran. For this reason, the present study tries to investigate the factors affecting citizens' continuous intention to use the rewarding solid-waste collection (RSWC) mobile apps in Tehran (the capital of Iran). In this regard, first, the conceptual model of the research is obtained by combining the widely used ECM model with D&M's IS success model. Then, the questionnaire designed based on previous studies was provided to the citizens, and out of a total of 373 completed questionnaires, by removing the incomplete ones, 302 questionnaires were finally analysed. A partial least squares (PLS) analysis based SEM using SmartPLS was performed to assess the model and verify hypotheses. Results show that various variables significantly influence users' continuous intention to use RSWC mobile apps. Meanwhile, RSWC mobile apps should improve their platform quality and rewarding system, strengthen their content quantity, and ensure the consistency between their service and citizens' satisfaction. © 2021 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

abstract={Energy has become the backbone of humanities daily activities. Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning systems (HVAC), which consume around 39% of energy in the residential sector, have turned into an essential constituent for providing fresh air, especially after COVD-19, not only in hospitals but also in any simple construction. Thus, decreasing this percentage or recovering part of the energy lost is an essential issue in today’s energy management scenarios. In this context, the present manuscript suggests a comprehensive review, classifications, critical analysis, and potential recommendations for energy recovery in air conditioning systems. It classifies energy recovery into two main categories: using lost energy for external uses, such as heating domestic water, or with other devices; and using lost energy for internal uses, such as the hot airflow which can be reused again for increasing efficiency of HVAC. In addition, this paper presents a summary of previous research and undertakes a review of the devices used for recovering energy. Furthermore, this review identifies superior devices in terms of climate and weather conditions. These objectives are accomplished by investigating around 190 published papers to conclude that energy recovery devices show a considerable effect on energy consumption in HVAC, mainly the heat pipe, fixed plate, and rotary wheel devices. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Because of the constantly increasing population of the Earth and the modern-day life, the municipal waste creation rate constantly grows. Organic and non-organic recyclable waste, which is a large part of the municipal solid waste generated, has caused increasing environmental concerns. The process of recycle is crucial for environmental sustainability. According to estimations from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, around 75 percent of the total waste can be recycled; and we only recycle 25 percent. The rest of the non-recycled waste is land filled and incinerated. By implementing new and novel recycling techniques, we can increase the recycling percentage and preserve natural resources and reuse the byproduct as industrial materials. The present paper presents an inexpensive yet reliable Smart Recycle Bin that based on modern technologies, such as environmental sensors and the LoRaWAn protocol to assist with the recycle process and automate the waste classification process. The proposed system can achieve 94.7% accuracy while it keeps the implementation costs complexity low, compared to similar projects found in literature. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={There is a general phenomenon of incoordination between garbage classification management and participation behavior, which seriously affects the sustainable management efficiency of domestic garbage. In order to solve this problem, this paper introduced the subject‐object‐process model into the waste classification management system, and constructed a mandatory classification management model of municipal solid waste and a comprehensive evaluation index system. Taking Beijing, China, as an example, the coupling coordination degree of garbage classification behaviors of residents in different was compared, and the coordination status of household waste management and behaviors was obtained. The results show that the synergy between government management and residents’ household waste classification behavior is between 0.40 and 0.68, and the synergy between enterprises’ participation in governance and residents’ behavior is between 0.45 and 0.75. The coordination degree between domestic waste management and residents’ participation behavior is generally in primary coordination or slight imbalance. The synergy degree between the secondary indicators of domestic waste management and residents’ behavior is higher than that of the tertiary indicators. Superposition effect of integrated management measures is better; among the psychological factors affecting residents’ classification behavior, the awareness rate and recog-nition degree of waste classification are very high, the awareness of environmental responsibility and social pressure are lagging behind. The study of synergy under the framework of subject‐object-process not only quantifies the overall synergy between management and residents’ behavior, but also provides a method to further implement garbage classification management in a targeted man-ner. Based on the synergy analysis, according to the weak links of various regions, classified management is carried out around publicity and education, supervision and management, assessment, rewards and punishments. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The effects of amending municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) with carbon capture and storage (CCS) via MEA (Monoethanolamine) technology differ according to the air pollution control technologies and energy recovery systems. Electricity output reduces by one-third for power-only plants and halves for combined heat-and-power plants, while variations in heat recovery depend on the presence of flue gas condensation. MSWI with CCS can capture roughly 800 kg of compressed CO2 per tonne of waste treated. Life cycle assessment (LCA) modelling of MSWI, with and without CCS, illustrates that despite energy penalties, CCS lowers its climate change impact. The difference in climate change impacts as a result of CCS amendment depends on the energy system in which MSWI operates. In a near-future energy system, MSWI with CCS reduces climate change impacts by 700 kg CO2-eq/tonne wet waste compared to MSWI without CCS. The climate change saving of CCS became increasingly larger as the energy system became “greener”; the climate change saving ultimately approached the capture efficiency (85% of CO2 in the flue gas) multiplied by the carbon content of the waste converted to CO2. Sensitivity analysis showed that capture efficiency was the main factor affecting the overall results, with increasing importance in non-fossil fuel-based energy systems. Likely changes in residual waste composition, as source segregation and collection systems improve, had only minor effects on the environmental benefits of CCS. The effects of CCS amendments on 13 other impact categories were marginal compared to the effects of different MSWI configurations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Recently Xiamen (China) has encountered various challenges of municipal solid waste management (MSWM) such as lack of a complete garbage sorting and recycling system, the absence of waste segregation between organic and dry waste at source, and a shortage of complete and clear information about the MSW generated. This article critically analyzes the existing bottlenecks in its waste management system and discusses the way forward for the city to enhance its MSWM by drawing lessons from Hong Kong's effectiveness in dealing with the same problems over the past decades. Solutions to the MSWM problem are not only limited to technological options, but also integrate environmental, legal, and institutional perspectives. The solutions include (1) enhancing source separation and improving recycling system; (2) improving the legislation system of the MSWM; (3) improvement of terminal disposal facilities in the city; (4) incorporating digitization into MSWM; and (5) establishing standards and definitions for recycled products and/or recyclable materials. We also evaluate and compare different aspects of MSWM in Xiamen and Hong Kong SAR (special administrative region) under the framework of ‘One Country, Two Systems’ concerning environmental policies, generation, composition, characteristics, treatment, and disposal of their MSW. The nexus of society, economics of the MSW, and the environment in the sustainability sphere are established by promoting local recycling industries and the standardization of recycled products and/or recyclable materials. The roles of digitization technologies in the 4th Industrial Revolution for waste reduction in the framework of circular economy (CE) are also elaborated. This technological solution may improve the city's MSWM in terms of public participation in MSW separation through reduction, recycle, reuse, recovery, and repair (5Rs) schemes. To meet top-down policy goals such as a 35% recycling rate for the generated waste by 2030, incorporating digitization into the MSWM provides the city with technology-driven waste solutions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Sorting of recyclables from source-segregated municipal solid waste (MSW) stream is an essential step in the recycling chain in a material recovery facility (MRF) for waste management. Manual sorting of recyclables in an MRF is a highly hazardous operation for human health as well as time-consuming. Application of robotics for automated waste sorting can alleviate these problems to a large extent. The total sorting time depends upon the pick-and-place (PAP) sequence used in a robotic sorting system. In this context, the generation of optimal PAP sequence plan is a key challenge considering that it cannot be solved by an exhaustive search due to the combinatorial explosion of the search space. This paper reports an approach for generating optimal PAP sequence plan for robotic sorting of recyclables from source-segregated MSW stream in a system equipped with thermal-imaging technique. The PAP sequence generation is formulated as an optimization problem wherein the objective is to minimize the total sorting time. The formulated problem has been solved using a genetic algorithm (GA)-based approach. Numerical simulations as well as physical experiments using a 6 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) articulated manipulator have been performed to test and validate the developed optimal sequence generation algorithm. Results revealed an improvement of up to 4.28% speedup in total sorting time over that of randomly generated sequences. It is envisaged that the developed approach can substantially improve the sorting performance in an MRF. © 2020 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Saudi Arabia) has started implementing the National Transformation Program (NTP) that aims to achieve government operational excellence, improve economic factors, and improve living standards as the country faces a high annual population growth rate and rapid urbanization. These increases lead to an increase in the levels of different waste products, which also lead to an increase in environmental pollution, the spread of diseases, harmful gases, and unwanted odors. One of the serious challenges facing the authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is managing this municipal solid waste (MSW) in a sustainable way that ensures reducing the resulting damage and using it to generate environmentally friendly energies. According to recent studies, organic waste is the largest component of waste generated in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which makes the process of sorting organic waste an essential requirement for any waste system applied inside the country. This paper aims to suggest an automated system for sorting organic waste using the Internet of things in Mecca city.

abstract={Motivations behind a country’s importation of waste are categorized into the pollution haven hypothesis (PHH) and the resource hunting hypothesis (RHH). The importation of wastes can lead to environmental sustainability concerns, requiring governments to intervene when the market fails to reduce the negative externalities by strengthening and implementing environmental regulations. Motivated by China’s position within a rapidly growing but environmentally damaging sector of trade, this paper has three goals: (1) to classify the primary hypothesis that governs China’s flow of traded wastes; (2) to verify the heterogeneous impact of the pollution paradise motivation and resource demand motivation of waste imports from developed and developing countries, and across industries; (3) to assess the impact of domestic environmental regulations on the motives behind China’s waste imports. Using 28 imported waste-varieties from 20 of China’s major trade partners across 24 years, findings indicate that the flow of Chinese waste imports is relatively unresponsive under the pollution haven effect. However, the resource hunting effect from developing countries is significantly greater than what originates from developed countries, despite the laws of 2011 and 2017 established to restrict resource hunting activities. These results have important implications for improving the efficiency of China’s waste sorting and recycling systems. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Municipal solid waste management has been one of the most critical issues of urban cities today. Increasing population, constructions, industries, etc. are the major factors creating a large amount of waste that is dumped onto the landfill sites. Various systems have been proposed and are under the utilization for the management of municipal waste which includes mechanical vibration-based size-based sorters, eddy current sensor-based sorting of metallic waste, automatic optical waste sorters, etc. This paper focuses on a novel solution for solid waste segregation using the concepts of machine vision and deep learning. The proposed concept is tested for the segregation of solid dry waste particularly plastic bottles, aluminum cans, and tetra packs. The prototype system developed for the segregations works at high speed and accuracy. The prototype system sorts 250 objects per minute with an average accuracy of 96%. The proposed novel idea be extended and implemented for other types of waste segregation and can include more categories of solid dry waste. The system provides a solution for the ever-challenging municipal waste management problem. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Waste sorting is an effective means of enhancing resource or energy recovery from municipal solid waste (MSW). Waste sorting management system is not limited to source separation, but also involves at least three stages, i.e., collection and transportation (C&T), pretreatment, and resource utilization. This review focuses on the whole process of MSW management strategy based on the waste sorting perspective. Firstly, as the sources of MSW play an essential role in the means of subsequent valorization, the factors affecting the generation of MSW and its prediction methods are introduced. Secondly, a detailed comparison of approaches to source separation across countries is presented. Constructing a top-down management system and incentivizing or constraining residents' sorting behavior from the bottom up is believed to be a practical approach to promote source separation. Then, the current state of C&T techniques and its network optimization are reviewed, facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things technologies. Furthermore, the advances in pretreatment strategies for enhanced sorting and resource recovery are introduced briefly. Finally, appropriate methods to valorize different MSW are proposed. It is worth noting that new technologies, such as AI, show high application potential in waste management. The sharing of (intermediate) products or energy of varying processing units will inject vitality into the waste management network and achieve sustainable development.

abstract={This paper summarizes the arguments within the scientific discussion on the issue of reducing municipal waste in municipalities in Slovakia. The aim of the paper is to examine the environmental and economic impacts of waste management in municipalities in Slovakia and to determine the impact of the introduction of a coupon system in the field of municipal waste sorting in municipalities. Methods of research were focused on using statistical indicators for the valuation of municipal waste, cluster analysis, regression analysis, and comparison analysis. The object of research were chosen 8 municipalities in Slovakia that implemented coupon system of waste sorting. The research empirically confirms and theoretically proves that the development trend of municipal and separated waste has a linear progressive course that means increasing of municipal waste and separated waste. The indicator RSquare indicates that the number of inhabitants affects the generation of municipal waste at 67,03%. Defined three clusters can be a tool for the classification of municipalities in the sorting of municipal waste after the implementation of a coupon system. The results of the research can be useful for legislative changes in Waste Law in Slovakia and opportunities for law changes in municipalities in the EU. © 2021, HARD Publishing Company.

abstract={Plastics have multiple applications in disposable products, high-end technology parts, etc., owing to their functionality and manufacturing flexibility. However, their increased use has increased the global proportion of plastic wastes, which creates a serious environmental issue, thereby, creating a demand for plastic waste management techniques. Improving the efficiency of resource recovery by appropriate sorting and collection systems is necessary for successful plastic recycling. Therefore, this study proposed a three-step optimization process of a reverse vending machine (RVM), a small automatic recyclable waste sorter/collector system, for acquiring an optimal design and enhanced efficiency. The RVM system categorized recyclable wastes as plastics, glass, and cans using barcode, vision, and near infrared sensors. The average sorting efficiency of the designed RVM system was 94%, 95% for polyethylene terephthalate, and 98% for glass bottles. Therefore, the RVM system, with the average sorting efficiency of 95%, is suitable for application in on-site sorting in small-sized areas, such as convenience stores, which generate wastes on a small scale.

abstract={Minimization of the environmental impact of the incineration process and to produce energy efficiently are the most important considerations in obtaining efficient operation of waste-to-energy (WtE) plants. WtE operation can obtain significant improvements by predicting combustion properties of municipal solid waste (MSW) prior to incineration. Combustion properties of MSW can be assessed by estimating the weighted waste fractions such as paper and cardboard, plastic or inert and fines. Waste materials and fractions can be recognized using imaging techniques and image classification methods based on deep convolution neural networks (CNN). We have tested a new sensor system for image classification based on using multispectral (MS) images and deep CNN pretrained on the ImageNet database to recognize MSW categories. MS camera was used for sampling images above the walking floor of a WtE plant (StatKraft Varme Tiller, Trondheim). The waste load was automatically registered as industrial or household waste at the time of delivery. The MS images from 49 waste loads were used to perform transfer-learning on EfficientNetB0 model weighted with ImageNet-NoisyStudent parameters. Using the predefined classes, a test and training set were generated from the 49 waste loads delivered between June and September (2020). The training set consisted of 35 waste loads while the remaining 14 waste loads were used as test. The weights for the image feature extraction was constant during training while the fully connected layer (top-layer) was updated for each epoch. The model performance on the test set was assessed by making predictions on the household or industrial waste images. With a fixed threshold value at 0.5, the model showed 85% accuracy, 92% precision, 89% recall and 90% F-measure for industrial class, while for household class the model showed 80% accuracy, 94% precision, 81% recall and 87% F-measure. For all threshold values, the area under curve estimated from the receiver operating characteristic plot showed that the model has 87% confidence in distinguishing household waste images from industrial waste images and 90% confidence in distinguishing industrial waste images from household waste images. © 2021 SPIE.},

abstract={Czech Republic has been moving from landfill-based waste system toward resource-based waste management system with an increasing rate of recyclable waste in the last years (38.6% of recycling by material and 11.7% of energy recovery in 2018). However, landfill is still a popular way of mixed municipal solid waste (MMSW) disposal due to the low tax. In the Czech Republic, MMSW is collected from households by door-to-door system or recovery operations (Household Waste Recycling Centre) and only should consists of everyday items, which are further non-recyclable and non-reusable. However, a significant amount of recyclable waste can still be found in MMSW. Therefore, a good knowledge of the physical composition of MMSW is required to define strategy plans and improve waste management in municipalities. This work is aimed at comparing the physical composition of MMSW in the Czech Republic with small municipalities up to 2,999 inhabitants and big municipalities from 3,000 inhabitants to recognize the share of recyclable and non-recyclable waste in MSW and designate the potential of separation at source. Composition of MMSW was determined by a physical evaluation of waste collected from households in target municipalities which consists in a detailed manual sorting of waste into 13 specific groups according to their types, and weighting by a scale. We found that the real proportion of MMSW that could no longer be reused or recycled was much less than the amount disposed of in the municipal waste bins. A large part of MMSW consisted of organic waste together with food waste. This type of waste is especially useful when people turn it into compost to prevent the production of waste and it returns the nutrients back to the soil, closing the circle. The rate of recyclable waste was also high in many municipalities covered by our analyses, which indicated a lower rate of separation and reflected an insufficient sorting system in municipality and insufficient education of inhabitants. On the other hand, it points to the larger space of separation potential in households. In conclusion the evaluation emphasizes the improper proportion of MMSW in Czech municipalities. A lot of waste can be recycled but once it is thrown into black bins as MMSW, there is no chance that it will be reused/recycled. It therefore calls for measures to improve sorting at source, which will benefit municipal authorities in term of increasing recycle rates in order to comply with regulations and make a profit. We found the analysis of the physical composition of MMSW as a fundamental method for municipalities to verify the separation rate at the source, and it is recommended to conduct this analysis regularly and monitor developments. © 2021, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

abstract={Buffalo City, which incorporates East London, faces some of the most significant development challenges of any urban centre in South Africa. In addition to lying in one of the poorest regions in the country, it was one of the most profoundly disrupted centres during apartheid - creating a legacy that has been difficult to disentangle. Colonial-era segregation and the apartheid system resulted, inter alia, in racially-based group areas and the creation of a new ‘Homeland’ city, Mdantsane, to which thousands of blacks were forcibly relocated. Against this backdrop and within varied theoretical perspectives, this chapter focuses on a number of critical geographical and environmental issues that emerged in the area in the post-apartheid period. These include municipal restructuring and the establishment of the Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality (BCMM); the failure of the local municipality in particular to address environmental justice issues related to solid waste management, the proper maintenance of beaches, and the protection of marine resources; the socio-economic transformation in Mdantsane; residential desegregation and socio-spatial restructuring; engagements amongst the poor in urban agriculture; human rights and human trafficking in the municipality; and spatial injustice and citizens’ conflicts stemming from rampant corruption and the collapse of good governance within the BCMM. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Plastic waste management is a challenge for the whole world. Manual sorting of garbage is a difficult and expensive process, which is why scientists create and study automated sorting methods that increase the efficiency of the recycling process. The plastic waste may be automatically chosen on a transmission belt for waste removal by using methods of image processing and artificial intelligence, especially deep learning, to improve the recycling process. Waste segregation techniques and procedures are applied to major groups of materials such as paper, plastic, metal, and glass. Though, the biggest challenge is separating different materials types in a group, for example, sorting different colours of glass or plastics types. The issue of plastic garbage is important due to the possibility of recycling only certain types of plastic (PET can be converted into polyester material). Therefore, we should look for ways to separate this waste. One of the opportunities is the use of deep learning and convolutional neural network. In household waste, the most problematic are plastic components, and the main types are polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene. The main problem considered in this article is creating an automatic plastic waste segregation method, which can separate garbage into four mentioned categories, PS, PP, PE-HD, and PET, and could be applicable on a sorting plant or home by citizens. We proposed a technique that can apply in portable devices for waste recognizing which would be helpful in solving urban waste problems. © 2021 Janusz Bobulski and Mariusz Kubanek.},

abstract={With the development of science and technology, China has basically realized the goal of building a moderately well-off society in an all-round way. As people's income and quality of life are constantly improving and their consumption level is gradually increasing, the quantity of household garbage is also growing rapidly. It is of great urgency to implement the classification and management of household garbage to make full use of garbage resources and reduce environmental pollution as well as land resource occupation. In order to conduct the classification and management work of household garbage more efficiently, this paper develops a garbage detecting system using a lightweight model MobileNetV3_Lite, which is promoted from MobileNetV3, as the backbone network to reduce computation and building up a YOLOV3-MobileNetV3_Lite detection model. The model successfully detects four categories of garbage, effectively and accurately determining the category and quantity of the waste. After the model is exported, deployed, and tested on NVIDIA Jetson Nano, the frame rate is up to 25. In the actual test, the accuracy for judging the category of garbage reached 94.56% and 90.91% for detecting the quantity of each category of garbage. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The recently finalized research project “ZRR for municipal waste” aimed at testing and evaluating the automation of municipal waste sorting plants by supplementing or replacing manual sorting, with sorting by a robot with artificial intelligence (ZRR). The objectives were to increase the current recycling rates and the purity of the recovered materials; to collect additional materials from the current rejected flows; and to improve the working conditions of the workers, who could then concentrate on, among other things, the maintenance of the robots. Based on the empirical results of the project, this paper presents the main results of the training and operation of the robotic sorting system based on artificial intelligence, which, to our knowledge, is the first attempt at an application for the separation of bulky municipal solid waste (MSW) and an installation in a full-scale waste treatment plant. The key questions for the research project included (a) the design of test protocols to assess the quality of the sorting process and (b) the evaluation of the performance quality in the first six months of the training of the underlying artificial intelligence and its database. © 2021 by the authors.

The Unit Pricing System has been proved effective for household waste sorting by developed countries and regions, while rare developing countries have successfully introduced the system in their local context. The study, taking an interactive perspective of dominant factors of residents’ waste sorting and governments’ intervention, combines theoretical analysis with system simulation to dissect the evolution process of residents’ waste sorting and local governments’ Unit Pricing System policy making, and to provide a Unit Pricing System policy making tool to support policy implementations. The results suggest introducing a Unit Pricing System can significantly push ahead the household waste sorting behaviour for cities with relatively low initial status of environmental awareness, and immediately trigger sorting behaviours for cities with higher initial status of environmental awareness. The study can also benefit other developing countries when imposing waste sorting management instruments. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={Food waste (FW) is an omnipresent phenomenon and there is no exception in Malaysia. Statistics compiled by SWCorp Malaysia indicate that Malaysians typically produce 38,000 t/d of municipal solid waste (MSW), in which FW encompasses about 40 % or 15,000 t/d. To make the matter worse, more than 80% of the FW ended up in open landfills with no energy recovery system, posing a serious environmental concern and energy waste. Meanwhile, the Malaysia Government proposed to reduce up to 40 % greenhouse gas emissions intensity of GDP compared to the 2005 level and realise the renewable energy mix to 20 % by 2025. While the Malaysia Government emphasises on solar and hydro powers as renewable energies, unavoidable FW should be recycled and valorised to renewable biogas and other value-added products as far as possible. Although the Malaysia Government has formulated plans to prevent and reduce FW, most of the FW is still yet to be recycled and separated from other MSW at the source. It is important to note that if FW is mixed with other MSW, it will be contaminated and cannot be recycled for beneficial use. Hence, a simple sorting process is essential to motivate the people to separate FW from the other MSW at the source. By considering the current FW management condition and societal needs in Malaysia, as well as taking reference from FW management systems in some cities such as Aarhus in Denmark and Oslo in Norway, a sustainable framework of FW collection via optic bag system and valorising to renewable biogas is proposed. The biogas could be used for generating electricity, heating gas, or upgraded to biogas vehicle fuel. Considering the 15,000 t/d of FW, it is able to supply biogas vehicle fuel to 341,250 cars which reduce CO2 (well-to-wheel), CO, NOX, and SO2 emissions by 2.67×106 t/y, 41.4×103 t/y, 4.98×103 t/y, and 12 t/y, respectively. The CO2 emissions reduction also accounts to about 1.07 % of total Malaysia’s CO2 emissions in 2018. Through the introduction of the optic bag system and valorisation of FW to renewable biogas, it is hoped that this proposed framework can provide a paradigm shift to the way FW planning carried out at the policy level. This, in turn, can create a more sustainable circularity waste strategy, resource-efficient, and greener economy in Malaysia. Copyright © 2021, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.},

abstract={Abstract: Biological wastewater treatment using algae–bacteria consortia for nutrient uptake and resource recovery is a ‘paradigm shift’ from the mainstream wastewater treatment process to mitigate pollution and promote circular economy. The symbiotic relationship between algae and bacteria is complex in open or closed biological wastewater treatment systems. In this regard, machine learning algorithms (MLAs) have found to be advantageous to predict the uncertain performances of the treatment processes. MLAs have shown satisfactory results for effective real-time monitoring, optimization, prediction of uncertainties and fault detection of complex environmental systems. By incorporating these algorithms with online sensors, the transient operating conditions during the treatment process including disruptions or failures due to leaking pipelines, malfunctioning of bioreactors, unexpected fluctuations of organic loadings, flow rate, and temperature can be forecasted efficiently. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art MLA approaches for the integrated operation of biological wastewater treatment systems combining algal biomass production and nutrient recovery from municipal wastewater.

abstract={In the context of the “smart city”, information and communication technologies (ICT) have become indispensable in the planning and design of modern municipal solid waste management. Due to more waste varieties, there are urgent calls to implement waste classification worldwide, which promotes resource recycling to achieve sustainable development. In this paper, we present an ICT-based smart waste classification and collection system (SWCCS) that is abstracted as a bi-objective mathematical programming model to optimize the waste collection problem. To implement the proposed SWCCS effectively, we design a novel multi-objective hybrid algorithm based on the whale optimization and genetic algorithms (MOGWOA) with an improved convergence factor and a fast, non-dominated sorting method. A comparison of our algorithm with two classical multi-objective algorithms on generated test instances and on a real-world case shows that the proposed MOGWOA is more effective for optimizing the established model. This paper demonstrates how the ICT-based SWCCS works and how it can help sanitation companies improve waste collection both economically and environmentally. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Industries produce a lot of waste that can affect the water PH, sometimes the water reservoir is exposed to dust, the Agric sector causes soil erosion due to its physical soil irritation or not enough care is taken by the departmental authorities. Although there's effort in urban areas by municipalities to purify and monitor the water used for consumption, the existing mechanism used is not as automated and reliable, even worse in rural areas no proper care is taken or no genuine mechanisms put in place. In this paper, Water Quality with Notifications System is presented to better the lives of the people by providing an easy and simple mechanism to know the water quality stored in the reservoir. It holds different sensors for getting water quality parameters namely PH Sensor, Nitrate Sensor, Turbidity Sensor, Water Level Detection Sensor. The system gets water parameters from the sensors through Raspberry Pi. It is a portable system and no monitoring authority is required at the water source 24 hours a day. Also, it is a mobile and portable system that is connected to an android smart phone. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The main aim of this study was to examine residents’ environmental behavior in sorting solid household waste, and to identify the integrative factors that contribute to their wasteseparation cooperation and other related pro-environmental behaviors. This was achieved based on a questionnaire survey in Shenyang, Chengdu, and Shanghai. Methodologically, we applied a discrete choice model to examine whether individuals’ garbage sorting behaviors differ based on their characteristics, social attributes, residential circumstances, and environmental awareness, and whether these factors are correlated with individuals’ receptiveness to a refuse charge system, or to policies requiring garbage sorting. We further examined whether individuals’ garbage sorting behavior, their receptiveness to fee-based waste collection, and their receptiveness to policies requiring garbage sorting differ across areas. In this particular survey, we introduced a 16 item scale of pro-environmental behavior and a nine item scale of altruism to ascertain the ways in which internal motivational factors affect people’s environmentally conscious voluntary behavior. Overall, the present work is expected to contribute to an important understanding of the motivational forces and incentives behind human pro-environmental behavior and action. It also brings relevance to the analysis of moral solidarity in relation to the household waste disposal problems currently confronting us today. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Pollution from discarded plastic has become a serious environmental problem. The Great Pacific garbage patch consisting of abandoned plastics is killing marine life. In addition, micro-plastics decomposed by solar UV radiation and waves can accumulate in the human body. Recycling plastic is accordingly a critical element of waste management. As part of the solution to this problem, factory automation in recycling plants to handle more waste faster is essential. The amount of reproduced raw plastics is proportional to the inlet speed of the plastics waste stream into a recycling process line. Furthermore, the quality of recycled products with reproduced raw plastics depends on the sorting purity through the line. Thus, an automated system should be capable of real-time classification of the plastics category and rapid manipulation for removing selected plastics. We propose a real-time sorting system for mixed color plastics by applying a machine learning algorithm and a parallel manipulator with a vacuum suction pad. The learning data and picking test samples were collected from a municipal waste disposal site at RM corporation factory. This work shows the feasibility of real-time plastics recycling automation and a future development direction. © 2020 Institute of Control, Robotics, and Systems - ICROS.},

abstract={In order to protect the ecological environment on which human beings depend for existence and make the society sustainable development, it is more and more necessary to classify the garbage. However, people are not familiar with the classification method, so it is difficult for us to accurately understand the classification of each kind of garbage. In order to guide people to classify garbage correctly, this paper proposes a garbage classification system based on Mask Scoring RCNN. Make a new data set based on Beijing municipal domestic garbage classification criteria, and use Mask Scoring RCNN for training. It is hoped that this system can help people classify garbage accurately and reduce the waste of time caused by garbage classification. The test results show that the garbage classification system in this paper has a high accuracy, and the segmentation recognition effect is better in the case of complex picture, which can efficiently and conveniently complete the garbage classification guidance task. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The rapid urbanization process is escalating the urban waste problem, and ineffective management has worsened the issue, leading to severe consequences to the population health and economy. Although many countries have started to charge money for large household items, it is time-consuming and challenging for collectors to distinguish various types of bulky waste manually. As a result, this study introduces a mobile-based automatic bulky waste classification system. The original contributions include (1) a fine-tuned VGG-19 model is proposed to classify 95 types of bulky wastes; (2) three hybrid models are introduced to efficiently handle the imbalanced data problem, including class-weight VGG-19 (CW_VGG19), eXtreme Gradient Boosting VGG-19 (XGB_VGG19), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine VGG-19 (LGB_VGG19); (3) a large dataset that includes 95 classes, and each class contains over 500 images; and (4) the development of a mobile application that used the proposed model. Experiments show that the model obtained an accuracy of 86.19%, which outperforms existing models in classifying bulky waste. Moreover, the proposed hybrid models showed their robustness against imbalanced data under various scenarios. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In this paper the plastic sorting system of the waste processing line is considered. Plastic is a valuable raw material for recycling but only 10% of plastic waste is processed nowadays in Russia. Two main methods of waste recognition are applied in two separation stages: spectrometry and computer vision. The implementation of municipal solid waste sorting system using the near infrared and visible spectrum spectrometers can significantly increase the efficiency of separation process in comparison with manual sorting. But the quality of separation is still low because this plastic cannot be separated by color using this method and a lot of impurities are included. The evident conclusion is the need for two-stage of sorting process: the rough but fast sorting using spectrometry and fine sorting using optical methods. Another issues of this paper are related to optical recognition subsystem: we propose a fast multi-level recognition system, the first level is the detection of the object presence on the line and the analysis of camera focusing, the second is the classification of the plastic object using the joint solution of several neural networks. This approach helps to decrease the total operating time by estimating the necessity of neural network running and by avoiding the blurred and faulty image processing. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Introduction of invasive species can have a profound impact on food web structure and therefore on trophic transfer of contaminants. In the St. Lawrence River (Canada), 20 years after its first detection in the system, invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) has become the main prey for several piscivorous species. To evaluate the accumulation, trophic transfer, and the ecological risk of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in this recently modified freshwater food web, samples of sediment, invertebrates, fish and aquatic bird eggs and plasma were collected. Sampling sites were located upstream and at two locations downstream of the Montreal wastewater treatment plant outfall. The results suggest that the influence of the WWTP effluent on PBDEs concentrations varied among the various compartments of this recently modified freshwater food web. The results also suggest that although predatory fish have switched to consuming round goby as a prey item instead of native yellow perch, this new feeding behaviour is not expected to have important impacts on the level of transfer of PBDE within this food web. The biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs) ranged from 0.6 to 436, whereas biomagnification factors (BMFs) varied between 0.2 and 475. Despite our conservative method of risk assessment, we calculated an important risk for piscivorous fish and gull eggs within this study area. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={With the continuous growth of the cruise market in China, more and more port cities are involved in the cruise industry. At present, the development mode of each port is mainly determined by the location according to the urban development plan and industrial development plans. Due to the lack of overall planning within the region, the competition and waste of resources in the region are often happened in the early stage of port construction. In order to avoid such contradictions and improve the development efficiency of domestic cruise ports, a set of measurable and operable classification development model evaluation system is developed for the new entrants. On the basis of the empirical analysis of all domestic cruise ports, this paper analyses the development factors such as city grade, traffic status, tourism heat, port type and so on, combines the development achievements of each port, carries on the fuzzy cluster analysis to each port, forms the comprehensive classification table of China cruise port development mode, and then formulates the classification of cities to be identified by fuzzy recognition scheme. The empirical analysis shows that the comprehensive classification and development model established by the study is feasible and in line with the industry expectations. The study provides an effective basis for choosing development mode for new cruise ports in the future to avoid regional conflicts and achieve win-win regional development. © 8th International Symposium on Project Management, ISPM 2020.

abstract={Confronted with a series of problems caused by surging generation of municipal solid waste (MSW), the Chinese central and local governments have promulgated and implemented policies to deal with them, including promotions of the classification of MSW. However, to date, practical knowledge and understanding about benefits for garbage classification from its environmental performance perspective is still limited. The present study is purposed to comprehensively investigate the environmental effects of garbage classification on municipal solid waste management (MSWM) systems based on three proposed garbage classification scenarios in China, via a comparative life cycle impact assessment (LCIA). Taking advantage of Impact Assessment of Chemical Toxics (IMPACT) 2002+ method, this comparative LCIA study can quantitatively evaluate midpoint, endpoint, and single scored life cycle impacts for the studied MSWM systems. A Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis is carried out to test the effectiveness and reliabilities of the LCIA results. The LCIA and uncertainty analysis results show that MSWM systems based on various garbage classification scenarios have significant variations in the studied midpoint, endpoint, and single scored environmental impacts. Different garbage classification scenarios have their individual environmental-friendly superiority for specific impact categories. Overall, results of this study demonstrate that MSW treatment systems integrated with garbage classification are more environmentally friendly by comparison with non-classification; and that the more elaborate the level of MSW classification, the smaller its impacts on the environment. © 2020 by the authors.

Furthermore, high throughput data indicated that granules in settling tank-1 (ST-1) harbored slow-growing autotrophic organisms like Nitrosomonas and Nitrospira, while the flocs in settling tank-2 (ST-2) were dominated by fast-growing heterotrophic organisms including Ca. Accumulibacter, Dechloromonas, Flavobacterium, Arcobacter and Halomonas. Simulation results using computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method (CFD-DEM) modeling verified that the selection pressure created by the TST separator contributed to the retention of heavy granules (&gt;1.011 kg/m3 density) in ST-1 zone and the withdrawal of light flocs (&lt;1.011 kg/m3 density) from ST-2 zone. Therefore, the segregation of biomass using the TST system provides an opportunity to select for desired microbial populations and to optimize the nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance of the A2O-TST reactor. This study could add a guiding sight into the application of two-sludge system based on AGS technology for upgrading traditional A2O process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The household solid waste (HSW) classification management plays an important role in reducing and recycling urban garbage in current residential community. However, with the rapid development of urbanisation in developing countries and the continuous increase of urban waste, the traditional waste management modes and technologies cannot satisfy the newly emerged needs of collecting and transporting solid waste in the accurate and effective way. Under this background, this research carries out a preliminary study on the HSW classification system and the resource servitisation. According to the HSW classification process, a cloud-based product-service systems (PSSs) platform, targeting on managing those solid waste management resources such as internet of things enabled smart waste bin, is established. The proposed PSS platform will be illustrated from four layers: physical layer, management layer, service layer and application layer. Additionally, the multistakeholders' value analysis of the platform will be provided from five aspects. Finally, a PSS-based real-life case of managing household waste bin is investigated and analysed in order to verify the feasibility of the proposed platform. © 2020 European Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics.

abstract={Bottom ash from municipal solid waste incineration is usually treated in order to recover valuable materials like metals and to generate a mineral material for utilisation in construction industry or disposal. At present, different technologies and combinations thereof are used for bottom ash treatment resulting in different quantities and qualities of the final products (metals and minerals). So far, a comparison of these technologies is hardly possible based on the available literature. Hence, the present paper presents and applies a modelling approach that allows predicting the quantities and qualities (in terms of composition) of the final outputs of bottom ash treatment plants. In particular, material flow analysis models of five different bottom ash treatment plants were established on goods, material and element level and the mass and composition of the output flows of these plants were calculated based on an input of 118,000 Mg/a of bottom ash dry matter. The highest recovery of metals (up to 8640 ± 820 Mg/a iron, 1530 ± 220 Mg/a aluminium, 627 ± 73 Mg/a stainless steel and 608 ± 70 Mg/a heavy non-ferrous metals) can be achieved in plants that apply comminution before any ageing processes and are equipped with jiggers, inductive sorting systems and/or a high number of eddy current separators. The iron scrap fractions separated from bottom ash are contaminated by up to 114 ± 44 mg/kg Cd and up to 9900 ± 3300 mg/kg Cu, which might impair their suitability for recycling. Only minor differences in the composition of mineral material generated by different treatment plants could be observed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The implementation of domestic waste classification following the principles of reduction, recycling, and harmlessness is an effective method to improve the urban and rural environments and to promote resource recycling. However, in many developing countries, the community residents lack awareness of the benefits of classified collection, which leads to a lack of initiative to classify MSW. To make the people realize the importance of MSW classification and increase the classification dynamics, Suzhou, China was taken as an example in this study, and residential areas were selected as sampling sites for classified and mixed collection of domestic waste. The main components of the odorous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from the dustbins via different disposal modes were determined by sampling in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. In addition, the ozone formation potential (OFP) and human health risk assessment of the VOCs were analyzed. Halogenated compounds were the major pollutants from the household waste dustbins of the residential areas. However, aromatic compounds contributed the most to the OFP of the VOCs. The OFP of VOCs reached the highest peak in summer, which was 1.02 × 103 μg/m3. Furthermore, more attention needs to be paid in classifying waste to reduce the concentration of OFP. Although there was a carcinogenic risk in spring and summer, it declined after waste classification. Compared with mixed collection, the source-classified collection of garbage had advantages in terms of controlling the emission of VOCs, ozone formation potential, and human health risk. These results could provide the evidence demonstrating the advantages of waste classification and attract people's attention. Furthermore, the results can also provide impetus to those countries, where separate collection of waste has not yet been implemented, to improve the enthusiasm for classification and the integrity of waste classification system. Residents should be encouraged to classify household waste in residential areas. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The recycling of plastics from Waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) was constrained by the mix of types. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is suitable for polymer detection, and it is a rapid, non-destructive analysis method that can be applied to automatic on-line sorting system. The NIR spectra of four commonly recovered WEEE plastics, which are polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene/polycarbonate (ABS/PC) blend, was collected. The flame-retardant ABS showed difference from ABS in NIR spectra. Three classification methods, which are spectral angle mapper (SAM), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and linear discriminant analysis combined with principal component analysis (PCA-LDA), was tested. And the classification models trained on the virgin plastics have been compared with the models trained on the WEEE plastic to evaluate how these methods perform under limited training data. PLS-DA is one of the most widely used classification method in spectral data analysis, but it had unsuccessful prediction when the training set only included virgin plastics. But the overall prediction accuracy over 99% could be achieved by the other two whether the training set was the spectra of virgin plastics or WEEE plastics. In general, NIR spectroscopy has the competency of separating WEEE plastics. Finally, an automatic on-line sorting system was designed specifically for the large plastic segments from household appliances and electronics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The whole complex of soil properties formed during a long process of evolution is used in soil diagnostics. Following the genetic approach, which proposes the designation of a specific diagnostic horizon that represents stages of specific urban synlitogenic soil formation on thick human-made deposits, we face the problem of separating truly soil horizons from layers of man-made deposits, as both contain significant amounts of artefacts. In addition, they have similar chemical and physical-chemical properties corresponding to general geochemical characteristics of the urban environment. A comparative analysis of morphological and physical characteristics was conducted for several soils of loamy texture within the city of Moscow, Russia. Their morphological descriptions were accompanied by determinations of bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity and penetration resistance. For the analysis of morphological and physical properties, soil diagnostic horizons were arranged in four groups (synlithogenic urbic humus horizons, postlithogenic humus horizons, technogenic layers and horizons inherited from natural texturally-differentiated soils). Most of the studied soil profiles had significant contents of solid inclusions (domestic waste and building rubble) that allowed us to define them as Urbic Technosols, according to the WRB soil classification system. It was confirmed that, in addition to specific chemical and morphological properties, man-made urban soils had specific physical characteristics. The abundance of inclusions of building rubble and domestic waste had a strong influence on physical properties such as bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Heterogeneous distribution of such properties within urban soil profiles could be considered as their characteristic feature. As a result, this study confirmed the identification of certain diagnostic horizons by establishing statistically significant differences in their bulk densities and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Penetration resistance was shown to be a less informative parameter in this study. We believe that more data on physical properties of different types of horizons should be accumulated for making it possible to establish typical values of physical characteristics of such horizons. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Pipelines are urban infrastructure used as a means of transporting water (in small or large volume) across cities. One of the major challenges facing the transportation of water through pipeline infrastructure is the water lost through leaks caused by pipeline crack, corrosion, and third-party interference. Water loss through leaking pipes is recognized as a costly problem worldwide, strongly linked with a waste of precious natural resource, environmental pollution and financial loss. The water loss occurs in all distribution systems even though the volume of the losses differs. In severe cases, water loss level as high as 60% of the total input volume may occur. It, therefore, constitutes a major threat to the operation of municipal water services. Owing to its consequential effect, controlling water losses through pipe leakage detection and localisation is a major priority of municipal water service. Therefore, effective control of water losses is highly essential. This requires good leakage detection and localisation methodology as well as active decision making. To achieve this, decision support systems (DSS) have been utilised to detect and control leaks in water distribution systems. To this end, this paper presents a literature synopsis on the DSS utilised for leak detection and control in water supply systems. Research works in this domain are investigated. Finally, future studies are discussed. © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Extraction efficiency for the selected analytes was improved by optimizing the parameters such as solvent type, ratio and volume, dispersive solvent type/volume, mixing type and duration to increase overall analytical performance. Under the optimum chromatographic and extraction conditions, limits of detection values for bixafen and fipronil were determined as 7.3 and 6.1 µg L−1, respectively. Spiking experiments were performed for domestic and industrial wastewater, soil and mint samples to evaluate applicability and accuracy of the proposed method. Recovery results for the samples were calculated in the range of 89.4%–112.6% via matrix matching calibration strategy. It was determined that the detection power of GC-MS system was improved 7.8 times for bixafen and 119 times for fipronil over LOD comparisons of conventional GC-MS and B-DLLME-GC-MS systems. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Tremendous amount of waste is being produced with a rapid increase in population. The current world addresses loads of difficulties that include smart waste disposal systems. Collection, segregation, and disposal of waste are a chaotic process. It has become a matter of huge concern if the correct disposal system isn’t managed. Managing waste effectively and usage expeditiously can take the nation one leap forward. Dumping waste, landfills, burning waste will cause environmental pollution. Hence, proper waste management is the need of the hour for the ecologically sustainable development of many countries. The generated waste gets economic value only if it is segregated in an efficient manner. In this work, a smart waste disposal system is developed which will classify the wastes in numerous categories to form waste management easier and economical. The waste is sorted into wet, metals, and nonmetal wastes. The wet waste which includes biodegradable organic waste can be used to form compost, whereas the dry wastes like metals can be recycled and the rest can be disposed off. The paper proposes an easy way to detect and segregate waste into wet, metallic, and nonmetallic for domestic purposes. The prototype has been designed to sort the waste into wet, metallic and nonmetallic wastes. It comprises of two subassemblies, namely Bluetooth-controlled vehicle, to make movements of the device and a waste sorting subassembly to sort the waste into its respective bins. The waste has to be sorted into various types, and each of these types such as wet waste, metals, plastic has to be handled separately at the disposal area or land. Therefore, providing separate bins for each of the different types of wastes and sorting them in the initial stages reduces a large amount of work in handling the waste.

abstract={Automatic Waste Segregation is the process of classifying and separating waste objects into several categories for further treatment, it acts as a middle process between cumulative collection and waste treatment. Improper waste treatment not only causes pollution but also increases the overall cost of the waste treatment process, hence a proper waste segregation mechanism needs to be implemented before treatment. The paper is a successful attempt of creating a waste segregation mechanism with minimal cost and with minimal human intervention at household level with the help of deep learning specifically Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), image recognition and Internet of Things (IoT). The model classifies a waste as either biodegradable or non-biodegradable and segregates waste into separate compartments using a flap mechanism, the proposed model also sends feedback to the user in real time as when the bin requires maintenance. The neural network is trained using a large dataset consisting of approx. 13000 images combined with suitable hidden layers, 70-30 % images were used for training and testing respectfully. The proposed model gives accuracy of 92%. The classification and segregation happens in real time which helps to reduce overall human efforts and reduces cost of overall process. © 2020 Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt. Ltd.

Industrial and domestic waste are major sources of waste. Since people are not concentrating on the segregation waste into their basic streams is the cause for the unrecognition of the industrial waste, so the work is mainly concentrating on industrial waste. So, it is easy to use a solution for a segregation system through the smart dustbin which is also very cheap, at small and medium companies or industries which are sent directly for processing.

abstract={Marine plastic debris and microplastics have become a global concern because they affect all the oceans of the world. China is considered as the largest emitter of marine plastic debris and microplastics. As the number of land-based waste incineration and wastewater treatment facilities in China increased, it is particularly important to recalculate the discharge of marine plastic debris and microplastics from China. The corresponding emissions were calculated from relevant statistical data using existing estimation methods based on the literature reports on the emissions of marine plastic waste and microplastics. The results showed that 1.24-3.31 million tons of plastic debris entered the ocean in 2016 which is slightly lower than 1.32-3.53 million tons in 2010. It was estimated that about 109.95 trillion microbeads (131.78 t) were discharged from wastewater treatment plants (WwTPs), which is much lower than the 209.7 trillion microbeads (306.9 t) reported in 2014. In addition, 1296.95 trillion synthetic fiber microplastics (648.48 t) were discharged from WwTPs and 0.7885 million tons of synthetic rubber tires dust were produced in 2016. Fiber microplastics from laundry of synthetic textiles and dust from erosion of tires while driving are also important sources of land-based microplastics. By comparing the emissions of plastic debris and primary microplastics, as well as land-based waste treatment, marine litter pollution control and treatment in China with those from developed countries, China should strengthen land-based waste management by improving the 'ban on free plastic bags' and the domestic waste classification system. Also, a policy to 'limit plastic microbeads' should be implemented as soon as possible, and microplastics emissions from WwTPs should be investigated. Further countermeasures for marine litter pollution, such as formulating relevant laws and regulations and inspection and monitoring standards, need to be improved. Therefore, increase China's international influence on marine plastic debris and microplastics pollution control. © 2020, Editorial Board, Research of Environmental Sciences. All right reserved.},

abstract={The performance of lateritic soil treated with Bacillus coagulans (B. Coagulans) was assessed for use as hydraulic barrier material in municipal solid waste (MSW) containment use. The soil was classified as A-4(2) and SC using AASHTO (American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials) and the Unified Soil Classification System, respectively. Index, hydraulic conductivity, calcite content, and microanalysis tests were carried out. Soil specimens were treated with B. coagulans at one-third pore volume (i.e., the numerical difference between the initial degree of saturation before soaking in water and final degree of saturation after full saturation of the soil specimens in water) in stepped suspension densities of 0, 1.5×108, 6.0×108, 1.2×109, 1.8×109, and 2.4×109 cells/mL, respectively. Cementation reagent was poured on the compacted soil in the mold and allowed to percolate until partial saturation was achieved. Compacted specimens after treatment were placed in water for 24-48 h and then permeated in three sets using water only, water and leachate, and leachate only for a total duration of 90 days. Compatibility test results showed reduction in long-term hydraulic conductivity values for the different permeation regimens considered. Absolute values recorded varied from 7.10×10-10, 1.04×10-9, and 7.50×10-10 to 1.71×10-9 m/s, 1.69×10-9, and 8.28×10-10m/s when permeated with water only, sequentially with water and leachate, and with leachate only, respectively, at 0 and 2.4×109 cells/mL, respectively. Calcite content increased for specimens permeated with water only (i.e., from 4.00% to 4.80%) and decreased for specimens sequentially permeated with water and leachate (i.e., from 6.60% to 4.00%) and leachate only (i.e., from 4.80% to 4.00%). Results of chemical compatibility and microanalysis showed that the treated soil is compatible with MSW leachate with the exception of a few cases that did not meet the minimum permisible hydraulic conducutivity value of 1.00×10-9 m/s used for landfill purposes. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

At present, governments around the world have enacted waste classification laws and policies (WCLP) for MSW reduction. In order to construct a sound WCLP system, we analyzed and compared the typical WCLP systems of the United States, Japan and China. It shows that these three countries are focused on making laws and/or policies according to their own national conditions or specific situations.

abstract={To alleviate the depletion of resources, application of reverse logistics (RL) systems in the plastic manufacturing industries is necessary. Numerous challenges exist in the plastic industry that prevent sustainable RL of Plastic Solid Wastes (PSWs). These challenges include; logistics costs, production costs, raw material availability etc. The study assesses RL barriers facing the Zambian plastic manufacturing and/or recycling industries. It identifies sustainable strategies from success stories in developed economies. The barriers preventing sustainable implementation of RL in the Zambian context include; 'lack of household participation in PSWs recycling schemes,' 'lack of recycling technology and infrastructure,' 'ineffective enforcement of extended producer responsibility (EPR),' 'none-existence of legislations and regulations for effective enforcement of PSWs recycling and recovery,' and 'combination of different plastic materials that complicate recycling.' The study recommends the following strategies for implementation; 'having a household PSWs segregation system' and 'establishment of recycling ssystems for industries in the plastics industry.' The strategies provided in this paper are applicable to industries that manufacture and /or recycle other products. To policy makers and the government, the paper provides a foundation for developing policies. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The present research provides a quantitative assessment of households' preferences for different waste separation and handling schemes. We employ a choice-experiment based, nation-wide survey across Denmark. The findings support four different types of “waste sorters”; reflecting the heterogeneity in household waste sorting preferences. To illustrate, while one segment responds favourably towards sorting systems with the possibility for local collection points for hazardous waste and for sorting bio-waste, some segments express opposite responses. We found statistically significant relationships between the heterogeneity in household preferences for home waste sorting and households' sociodemographic characteristics, current self-reported time allocation for waste sorting and handling, use of recycling facilities as well as attitudinal factors on personal motivation and social influence. Furthermore, the findings reveal trade-offs between households' waste sorting preferences and the amount of time they have to spend sorting. We estimate a value of time for this pro-environmental activity of between 2.8 and 6.3 EUR per hour. Overall, the present research demonstrates that households express different preferences towards the practical design of waste sorting systems. This needs to be considered in the development of policy initiatives in order to achieve more effective sorting systems through higher rates of compliance from the public at large. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The ammonia nitrogen on-line monitor based on distillation-neutralization titration (HJ 537-2009) is mainly suitable for the determination of ammonia nitrogen in domestic sewage and industrial wastewater. It has the advantages of wide measuring range, non-Toxicity of reagents and waste liquor, etc. Focused on the water sample pretreatment system, conductance detection system and its key technologies to solve the problems including difficulty in precise sampling of water, difficulty in automatic addition of solid pH regulator, the low efficiency of distillation, the short stabilization time of mixing indicator, difficult to determine titration endpoints automatically and accurately (indicator discolouring point), long titration analysis time and so on. Meanwhile, a new ammonia nitrogen on-line monitor base on distillation-conductivity method was designed to measure some metering performance indexes, method detection limit (MDL) and limit of quantitation (LOQ). The results showed that the maximum absolute error of 0.02 mg/L on low concentration sample analysis (≤2 mg/L), the relative error reached-3.7 % on high concentration sample analysis (>2 mg/L). The method detection limit and limit of quantitation were 0.08 mg/L and 0.15 mg/L, respectively, which could satisfy the metering performance requirements in verification regulation of ammonia nitrogen automatic monitor. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This paper describes an application of a multi-objective optimization algorithm (i.e., the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II [NSGA-II]) and a fuzzy expert system (FES) to allocate municipal waste capacities to recycling, aerobic composting, incinerator, and landfill facilities with these objectives: (1) minimization of the economic cost; and (2) minimization of the environmental cost of the municipal solid waste management system. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II is used to find multi-objective solutions, and a FES is employed for the environmental cost evaluation. Tehran, the capital of Iran, is selected as the case study. In the proposed model, the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the municipal solid waste management issue are taken into account so that the economic and environmental objectives that typically arise in cities in this regard can be considered. To achieve economic and environmental cost objectives, five scenarios with different economic and environmental costs and four solid waste management methods (recycling, aerobic composting, incinerator, and landfill) are employed. The results show that while hybrid methods for municipal waste management can be used, recycling and aerobic composting are the principal methods—that is, the scenarios that utilized higher percentages of these methods resulted in the lowest economic and environmental costs. Additionally, the results of model validation using predicted and real data from the different scenarios demonstrate the high accuracy of the proposed model. © 2019, Islamic Azad University (IAU).},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to illustrate the growing role robots are playing in recycling and product disassembly and provide an insight into recent research activities. Design/methodology/approach: Following a short introduction, this first considers robotic waste sorting systems and then describes two systems for the disassembly of electronic products. It then provides details of some recent research activities. Finally, brief conclusions are drawn. Findings: Robotic systems exploiting artificial intelligence combined with various sensing and machine vision technologies are playing a growing role in the sorting of municipal and industrial waste, prior to recycling. These are mostly based on delta robots and can achieve pick rates of 60-70 items/min and be configured to recognise and select a wide range of different materials and items from moving conveyors. Electronic waste recycling is yet to benefit significantly from robotics although a limited number of systems have been developed for product disassembly. Disassembly techniques are the topic of a concerted research effort which often involves robots and humans collaborating and sharing disassembly tasks. Originality/value: This provides an insight into the present-day uses and potential future role of robots in recycling which has traditionally been a highly labour-intensive industry. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Correct sorting of this waste, including food packaging waste, is cost-effective, it facilitates the recycling process and enhances the quality of the recycled product. Although there is a growing body of research that studies the effect of different attributes of food packaging on household recycling behavior, the effect of these attributes on the sorting of the food packaging waste is not well known. This contribution reviews work that studies the relationship between attributes of food packaging and consumer sorting behavior. The review highlights the potential of the visual attributes and the quality of packaging as a communication channel for encouraging consumers to sort the food packaging waste.

abstract={China has dominated the global aluminum production and consumption in the past few decades, therefore it is of particular interest to stakeholders in China and worldwide to explore whether such aluminum boom will continue or not in China. This study applies a scenario-based dynamic material flow analysis to quantify the stocks and flows along the anthropogenic aluminum cycle in China from 1950 to 2100. Potential future changes of significant parameters are explored and identified, and around 250 sets of scenario results (including all flows, stocks, and losses along the aluminum cycle in China) are obtained for the comprehensive scenario analysis. The main findings include: (1) China's primary aluminum production will peak at around 30 MMT (million metric tons) at around 2025, leading to the end of primary aluminum boom that started from the early 1990s; (2) Domestic aluminum demand will continue to increase to more than 40 MMT due to the growing accumulation of in-use stocks in meeting future societal needs; (3) China's old aluminum scrap generation will increase dramatically (around 0.7 MMT per year) soon and secondary production will account for more than 60% of aluminum production after 2050s in almost all scenarios. Thus, there will be a rapid shifting in production capacity from primary to secondary routes. In this context, the corresponding policy should focus more on the urban mining, and improvement of end-of-life management systems and sorting technologies. These scenario results also reveal key opportunities and barriers in the process. Notably, it becomes increasingly important for China's and the global aluminum industry to investigate China's future role in the global market of primary and waste aluminum products. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The general aim of circular economy is the most efficient and comprehensive use of resources. In order to achieve this goal, new approaches of Industry 4.0 are being developed and implemented in the field of waste management. The innovative K-project: Recycling and Recovery of Waste 4.0 - “ReWaste4.0” deals with topics such as digitalisation and the use of robotic technologies in waste management. Here, a summary of the already published results in these areas, which were divided into the four focused topics, is given: Collection and Logistics, Machines and waste treatment plants, Business models and Data Tools. Presented are systems and methods already used in waste management, as well as technologies that have already been successfully applied in other industrial sectors and will also be relevant in the waste management sector for the future. The focus is set on systems that could be used in waste treatment plants or machines in the future in order to make treatment of waste more efficient. In particular, systems which carry out the sorting of (mixed) waste via robotic technologies are of interest. Furthermore “smart bins” with sensors for material detection or level measurement, methods for digital image analysis and new business models have already been developed. The technologies are often based on large amounts of data that can contribute to increase the efficiency within plants. In addition, the results of an online market survey of companies from the waste management industry on the subject of waste management 4.0 or “digital readiness” are summarized. © 2019},

abstract={A crucial prerequisite for recycling forming an integral part of municipal solid waste (MSW) management is sorting of useful materials from source-separated MSW. The morphological composition of the waste generated in Russia was studied. Theoretical bases of management of the waste sorting conveyor have been developed taking into account failures such as uneven loading and uneven sorting of waste. The calculation of the waste material balance was based on solving the system of Euler equations and flow control. Control laws are defined to control the flow and density of waste on the conveyor. A relay-contact scheme for automatic sorting of waste to extract various fractions of recyclable waste, such as metal, plastic, paper, glass and organic matter from MSW was developed. The synthesis of a finite state of a machine control system for waste sorting is implemented on a programmable logic device Omron. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The amount of municipal solid waste is globally increasing, leading to the need to arise the quantity of recycled materials. A relevant step in recycling is the macro sorting of waste, i.e., that part of the process where the waste is divided in groups in order to facilitate the following recycling processes. This activity is still mainly manual even if the presence of toxic and dirty components in the waste generally makes the working environment hostile and hazardous. In such a context, this paper proposes an approach for the optimization of the design and management of macro-sorting robotic systems. A first mixed-integer linear model is proposed for the optimal selection of the system resources as well as its flexibility level. A second model is used in order to manage system flexibility based on variation in the quantity of the waste to be sorted. The approach is tested on an industrial case, focusing on the macro sorting of mercury-free bulbs. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Insufficient landfills problem had increased the needs to decrease the waste and recycling them. However, despite the efforts done by the government and local authorities on promoting recycling culture by introducing new laws and regulations, the awareness and willingness among the community is still low. One of the possible reasons to this is lack of effort to categorize the waste into the designated category which are paper, glass, plastic and metal. In order to address this problem, it is important to design a system that will ease the process of categorizing the waste. This can be achieve by the automation of the said process. In this work, a system consist of an algorithm and hardware to automatically categorize recyclable waste is proposed. The proposed system are utilizing weight sensor and ultrasonic sensors in order to capture the characteristics of the waste item, which are weight and size so that it can be categorized into paper, glass, plastic and metal. Here, a sytem to automatically separate household waste item is presented by combining an algorithm with a set of hardware consist of minimal number of sensors, conveyer belt and servor motors. © 2019 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

abstract={Gaseous emissions from municipal solid waste (MSW)disposal plants pose serious odor pollution and health risks. In this study, the emission of volatile organic compounds and carbon disulfide was compared in the main processing units of three disposal methods, i.e., landfilling, eco-mechanical biological treatment (EMBT)and anaerobic fermentation in a MSW disposal plant. Among the detected volatile compounds (VCs), the top ten odor compounds were methanethiol, dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, carbon disulfide, styrene, m-xylene, 4-ethyltoluene, ethylbenzene, 2-hexyl ketone and n-hexane in the MSW disposal plant. Sulfur compounds were the main source of odor at the majority of sampling sites, and aromatic compounds were the dominant odor substrates at the tipping unit and sorting system of EMBT, while 2-hexanone was the major odor substrate at the tipping unit (AT)and sorting system (AS)of anaerobic fermentation and the landfill working surface. At AS and AT, the lifetime cancer risk values for 1,2-dichloroethane and trichloroethylene exceeded the carcinogenic risk value (>1.0E-04), and the hazard index values of naphthalene, trichloroethylene and acrolein all exceeded the acceptable level (>1). Therefore, special attention should be paid to VC emissions from MSW disposal facilities, and protection measures should be adopted for on-site workers to minimize health risks. © 2019},

abstract={Municipal solid waste incineration fly ash is directly landfilled after solidification in the industry. The rapid evaluation of contaminant leaching is required before the landfill of fly ash. In order to reduce the time to evaluate the effect of solidification, a set of rapid evaluation method was developed through the determination of characteristic index, heavy metal leaching analysis, principal component analysis, and mathematical model construction. It was found that f-CaO, acid neutralizing capacity, pH and soluble calcium were negatively correlated with heavy metal leaching. The soluble chlorine was positively correlated with heavy metal leaching. The effect of each feature indicators on heavy metal leaching was evaluated using principal component analysis and mathematical analysis software R.3.4.4. Furthermore, R.3.4.4 was used to detect the optimal model and the excess probability formula by stepwise linear regression and logistic regression analysis method. By introducing the measured value of feature indicator into the excess probability formula, the rate of excess-standard of heavy metals leaching can be preliminarily determined. Based on the above ideas, a rapid detection and evaluation system could be developed according to the local leaching standards and the components of fly ash selected locally. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={With the rapid growth of urban economy and population in China, the output of municipal solid waste (MSW) has dramatically increased becoming a constant threat to residents’ living environment and health. The classification intention of residents plays a pivotal role in solving the problem of MSW disposal. While numerous studies have examined the classification behavior of MSW from the perspective of ordinary residents and households, few studies have attempted to understand young people’s sorting intention. The novelty of this research is to explore the determinants that affect young people’s intention toward municipal solid waste sorting (MSWS) by extending the predictive factors of environmental concern and personal moral obligation into the theory of planned behavior (TPB). A sample of 524 young respondents from Hebei Province in China were used to conduct a structural equation model (SEM) validation. The empirical results revealed that, according to the rankings of significance, personal moral obligation, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norm had positive influences on young people’s intention toward MSWS, while attitude and environmental concern did not. Furthermore, the multi-group comparison showed that, compared with the male and rural group, the intention of female and urban respondents to classify MSW was not affected by subjective norms. Some targeted managerial implications were ultimately proposed to promote young people’s intention toward MSWS. This study contributes to the existing knowledge system of MSWS by revealing the classification intention of young people as a group. The findings and implications provide the government with useful insights for encouraging young people to actively participate in MSWS. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Increasing urbanization has led to a major waste management crisis with the proliferation of improperly planned structures having no proper facility to collect, segregate and process waste. Domestic waste has increasing chemical and plastic content. These chemicals do not perish unless treated properly. The treatment also necessitates timely collection, segregation and if possible decomposition, reuse or recycling. Human intervention has been the most popular way to segregate waste, but when it comes to working with a mixture of wastes, it puts their health and hygiene at stake. It is always better to treat waste through the help of robots which can handle waste in any hazardous environment. An automated waste collection and segregation system based on a robotic assembly and machine learning based classification is developed. A robotic arm with a distance sensor will pick up the waste and place it on a binary classifier platform which has a camera attached to capture the image and an algorithm to classify the waste as biodegradable or non-biodegradable into their respective bins. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={A multi-stage optimization approach for sustainable collection system design for urban municipal solid waste is developed for megacities in Asia’s newly industrialized countries. The approach combines four methods—analysis of waste and area characteristics, data acquisition and evaluation by GIS, mathematical projection of existing and future collection systems, and identification of most suitable alternatives through comparative multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The approach is applied in Bangalore, India with 1.66 million inhabitants and 46.7-km 2 area of investigation, and stratified based on population density. Two possible collection mechanisms (door-to-door (D2D) and community bin (CB)) are analyzed with a varied combination of collection coverage and waste segregation level. The study results confirm that both operational and investment expenses of the collection system decrease with an increasing rate of CB collection. Moreover, overall CO 2 emissions of waste collection from the entire area of investigation decrease from 5.2 to 3.1 tons per day if the present 100% D2D collection is replaced with 100% CB collection system. Also, the increase of segregation at source contributes to the reduction of operational expenses and CO 2 emissions; for example, a 20% increase of segregation level for D2D collection system leads to a 6% reduction of CO 2 emissions. Considering all decision parameters through MCDA, a collection system comprising only CB with one separate compartment for wet waste and another combined compartment for dry and mixed waste is determined to be the most favorable approach. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Municipal solid waste (MSW) management remains a challenge in developing countries due to increasing waste generation, high costs associated with waste management and the structure of the containment systems implemented. This study analyses the classification of landfilling systems by using documented cases reported mainly in publications in waste management in relation to non-engineered landfilling systems/approved dumpsites in Sub Saharan African (SSA) countries from 2000 to 2018. The work identifies an existing system for the classification of landfill sites and utilises this system to determine the situation of landfill sites in SSA countries. Each article was categorised according to the main landfilling management practice reported: Uncontrolled dumping, semi controlled facility, medium controlled facility, medium/high-engineered facility or high state-of the-art facility. Findings suggested that 80% of the documented cases of landfill sites assessed in SSA countries were classified as level 0 or 1. The structure of the containment and controlled regime were identified by the focus group discussion participants as important predictors of possible strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for the landfill sites considered. The study represents the first identifiable and comprehensive academic evaluation of landfill site classification based on site operations reported in the available peer reviewed literature. The information provides insight on the status of landfill sites in SSA countries with respect to the landfilling management practice and a baseline for alternative corrective measures. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In order to solve the rural living garbage processing problems, we independently developed a unique technology of clean and comprehensive utilization of rural garbage resources, referred to as PGAS technology. Based on modern biodegradation and automatic sorting, we built a complete industrial chain with mixed domestic waste as mineral raw material. The garbage trucks transport rural garbage and directly discharged into the hopper. Quickly biofilm is sprayed to deodorize garbage, then the garbage bags are teared at the same time of feeding. At the transportation, we utilize magnetic and eddy current sorting to get metal products and residues, while the residue will be transferred into the tearing machine and the biological treatment silo, where the raw garbage is mixed by composite bacteria liquid and enzyme liquid. The organic pus would be pumped to anaerobic fermentation system, while the residue would be alternatively tearing through broken drum to main sorting system. By our innovated equipment, we obtain inorganic material as sand and glass, pulp and sundries like bamboo textiles, and pure plastic at last. The products would be further processing to industrial materials as required of market. The sand and gravel glass and other inorganic materials can produce hollow blocks, paving brick and sponge brick. The pulp would change to the pulp products which can be directly used for producing cardboard and corrugated paper. The plastic can be packaged directly to sale, or be used in oil refining, even can be further sorted to monomer plastic, such as PE, and to produce particles. The slurry is pumped into the biogas tank for producing the methane gas through anaerobic fermentation system, which can be reused as energy. And the slurry after anaerobic fermentation, through evaporation, can be sprayed into powder or granular fertilizer. This technology subverted the traditional mode of rural waste disposal, which is the only comprehensive utilization of rural garbage with all components. The whole processing line is close with no smelly gas. There is no sewer in the whole plant with no waste water emissions, the water is in circulation. There is no operator in the whole plant, the sorting is automatic. Take the PGAS demonstration project in Yuanqu County, Shanxi Province as an example. The project was completed in 2017 and has been put into operation for 1 year with a processing capacity of 100 t/d. The radiation area includes 2 towns and 3 townships with about 100 000 people. According to this waste plant's operation data, treating 1 ton waste by PGAS, we can obtain the average amount of 65 kg organic fertilizer, 105 kg pulp, 124 kg plastic, 133 kg waste derived fuel, 135 kg sand, 55 kg methane and 11 kg metal. The cost is about 180 yuan, and the output value is about 325 yuan. The investment cost is nearly 40% less than that of incineration. After the sewage treatment, the removal rate of various pollution factors reaches 88.76% on average, which is used for recycling. It is proved that this technology can improve the efficiency of waste disposal. This technology has considerable economic benefits, is environmentally friendly, and has high promotion value. © 2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

abstract={The amount of toxic and harmful substances discharged into the water body by urban residents in production and living activities exceeds the water environmental capacity, which leads to the decline of the water quality function of the city. Urban industrial waste-water and domestic sewage are important sources of urban water pollution. The traditional water pollution detection and decision system has the problems of low data accuracy and large data delay. These problems restrict the rapid decision-making of water pollution response strategy and pose a greater threat to the urban crisis emergency response system. The water pollution monitoring and rapid decision-making system is researched in this paper. The artificial intelligence immune agent is proposed and applied in this paper to solve the problem of low data accuracy and the delay caused by the dynamic environmental change. The experiment result shows the proposed method can improve the performance of the system by using this method. © 2019, Scibulcom Ltd.. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: The ecological state of surface waters is typically assessed by a multi-aspect approach based on a determination of its chemical and physical parameters, by hydromorphology and the use of indicator organisms such as benthic diatoms. By assigning ecological indicator values, it is possible to create diatom indices which serve as the basic tool in assessing the ecological status of surface waters. These ecological indicator values are set according to classification systems, such as the Van Dam, Mertens & Sinkeldam (1994) system, which classifies species of diatoms according to seven different ecological factors. However, recent studies on the autecology of diatoms have shown the need to verify and establish new ecological indicator values. To this end, aquatic ecosystems are good environments to observe the range of tolerance of benthic diatoms to environmental conditions due to their unique physical and chemical parameters. The aim of the present study was to propose the establishment of new, or altered, ecological indicator values, according to the Van Dam, Mertens & Sinkeldam (1994) classification, of species of diatoms characteristic of three post-mining aquatic ecosystems. Methods: In total, 36 species were identified that were characteristic of three waterbodies: a salt aquatic complex (water outflow, a drainage ditch and a pond), mined iron ore reservoirs and a mined lignite reservoir. Their ecological indicator values were specified using OMNIDIA software, and the environmental conditions prevailing in the studied ecosystems were determined. Of the 36 characteristic species, 16 lacking at least one assigned ecological indicator value were analyzed further. The analysis identified three groups of selected characteristic species which showed a correlation, or lack of such, to the tested physical and chemical parameters. Results: Based on this multistage study of the autecology of characteristic diatoms, comprising an analysis of environmental conditions, literature analysis and reference ecological indicator values of other species, it is proposed that 32 ecological indicator values be established or adjusted for 16 species, and that Planothidium frequentissimum be excluded from water quality assessments. © 2019 Olszynski et al.},

abstract={Today, considerable amounts of resources are landfilled or incinerated, and recyclable materials such as metal, glass, plastic, and paper are disposed of as residual waste instead of being sorted into recyclable fractions. Recycling is one way of transitioning towards a circular economy and a more resource-efficient society. However, in many older cities there is insufficient space for waste bins, which makes waste sorting difficult. The aim of the study was to test how the introduction of a new kerbside collection system, using different-coloured plastic bags, would influence the amounts of residual waste and separately collected food waste. Coloured plastic bags were introduced in an old city centre in Kalmar, in the southeast of Sweden. This type of kerbside collection was applied to 38 apartments with a total of 87 residents for four weeks. Results show that residual waste decreased directly by 15 percent and the collected amount of food waste increased directly by 35 percent. The residents perceived that the sorting system facilitated sorting and that the sorting of recyclable materials increased. Kerbside collection, close to properties, seemed to be an important factor in reducing the amount of residual waste, leading to increased sorting, and hence improved recycling. © 2019 by the authors.

In this paper, the industrial robot sorting system platform is built by deep learning technology. Firstly, the visual area on the conveyor belt is captured by the depth camera. The computer uses a trained SSD model to recognize and locate the target, and obtain the information on the type and location of the solid waste. Then, based on the object detection, solid waste objects are segmented by three-dimensional background removal. Finally, the information of the geometric center coordinates and the angle of the long side of the target object are sent to the robot to complete the classification and grabbing of the solid waste. Simulation experiments show that the features learned by using SSD deep neural network have strong robustness and stability in complex environment, and can achieve the solid waste sorting efficiently. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Inherent variability in engineering properties of lateritic soil in relation to its plasticity, permeability, strength, workability, and natural moisture content, has made it an unpredictable material for use in civil engineering works, resulting in the need for its treatment by stabilization. A lateritic soil classified as A-6(6) and CL, according to American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials and Unified Soil Classification System of ASTM (2011), was treated with up to 10 percent waste wood ash (WWA). Compaction was carried out using four energies, namely, reduced British Standard light, British Standard light (BSL), West African Standard, and British Standard heavy, on samples, which were then examined for hydraulic conductivity, volumetric shrinkage, and unconfined compressive strength as major criteria for use as liner and for the development of acceptable zones. Specimens with 4 percent WWA content compacted with a minimum BSL energy satisfied the maximum hydraulic conductivity (k) value of 1 × 10−9 m/s, maximum volumetric shrinkage strain of 4 percent, and minimum unconfined compressive strength value of 200 kN/m2 required for use as liner in engineered landfills. The overall acceptable zone was enlarged for up to 4 percent WWA content, thereby accommodating higher moulding water content, but the minimum compactive effort required to achieve it became reduced. The beneficial treatment of lateritic soil with up to 4 percent WWA will perform satisfacto-rily as liner and covers in waste containment application and will minimize the pollution and environmental impact of wood waste disposal. © 2019 Geological Society of America.

This paper presents a theoretical framework of an integrated approach of solid waste management system in which a waste segregation layout is shown including waste to energy (WtE) application of the refused derived fuel formed in the process. Real-time monitoring of the segregation process and energy extraction process is done using internet of things (IoT) application. Segregation of waste before processing gives an efficient way of waste management and with this framework, one can easily monitor and acquire various information obtained during different stages of segregation and energy extraction process. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Water Distribution System (WDS) are employed in everyday life either for domestic or for industrial purpose. WDS are large scale systems that need the design of better leak detection methods to avoid water waste. Recently, researchers concerned about WDS have focused their research on water leakage detection techniques. However, the different existing techniques failed to improve the performance of accuracy and time consumption during water leakage detection. In order to address the above mentioned issues, Bivariate Correlation and Sensitivity Analysis based Meta-Heuristic Grey Wolf Optimization (BCSA-MHGWO) Technique is introduced. The main aim of the BCSA-MHGWO technique is to detect the water leakage with a minimal number of sensor placed nodes. Initially, WDS is represented in graph model comprising a set of vertices (i.e., nodes) and set of edges (i.e., pipes). The sensitivity and entropy value is calculated for all nodes based on the pressure and flow rate. After calculating the sensitivity value, the correlation value of all nodes is measured by using bivariate correlation coefficient based on the pressure series. Finally, grey wolf optimization process is carried out in BCSA-MHGWO technique to select the optimal nodes for sensor placement based on the sensitivity, entropy and correlation value for water leakage detection. In this way, water leakage detection accuracy and time performance get improved using BCSA-MHGWO technique. The performance of BCSA-MHGWO Technique is measured in terms of water leakage detection accuracy, water leakage detection time, and false positive rate. The simulation results show that BCSA-MHGWO Technique improves the performance of water leakage detection accuracy and also reduces water leakage detection time when compared to state-of-the-art works. © BEIESP.},

abstract={In this paper, taking the South China area as an example, a list of construction wastes has been established based on the bill of quantities, and a calculation method for the production of construction waste of new residential projects has been proposed. According to the existing research data, the scrap rate of the main materials is obtained, and the waste production of the newly-built project is estimated, which is 0.326 m³per unit area. The model in this article estimates the amount of construction waste and promotes the classification and reduction of construction waste at the construction site. It is recommended to adopt source reduction measures, implement a classification system and improve relevant laws and regulations, as well as optimize the waste market. Meanwhile, this model includes waste production budget into bidding, providing reference for improving the management level of domestic construction departments. © 2019, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.},

abstract={Waste mechanics focuses on the degradation characteristics and mechanical behaviors of municipal solid waste (MSW). Knowledge of waste mechanics helps solve the severe geoenvironmental challenges for MSW landfills. This paper first summarized and compared the physical components and chemical composition of MSWs from 20 countries, including developed and developing countries, and proposed a MSW classification system based on the food waste content and the ratio of cellulose to lignin. Secondly, the degradation characteristics between high food waste content (HFWC) and low food waste content (LFWC) MSWs, originated from their differences in chemical composition due to the distinctions in physical components of MSWs, were compared quantitatively by mass loss, leachate generation, landfill gas (LFG) generation, and contaminants in leachate. Thirdly, mechanical behaviors closely related to the degradation characteristics of both HFWC and LFWC MSWs, including permeability, compressibility, shear strength, and lateral pressure, were elaborated on. Fourthly, degrees of hydrolysis, methane generation, and consolidation, calculated by the stabilization-consolidation model, were introduced to characterize the stabilization process of HFWC MSW landfills, which provided a basis for sustainable landfilling for HFWC MSW landfills. The obtained features of HFWC MSW landfills, including the distributions of leachate mounds and LFG, settlement, and slope stability, showed the causes of main geo-challenges at HFWC MSW landfills, including high risks of leachate leakage and slope instability, and low LFG collection efficiency, were consistent with the monitoring results of several cases. Finally, technologies, practices, and designs towards sustainable landfilling for HFWC MSW landfills in China were presented, which could also serve as useful references and guidelines for other countries in similar situations. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

The garbage problem in the urbanized territories is one of urgent ones for today. The most widely used ways of cleaning (destruction) of garbage is its burial in the grounds. As a result, big territories are occupied with such grounds and cannot be used, in addition, the impact on the environment is made. In the paper the use of a system approach, which consists in sorting of garbage at the stage of collecting municipal solid waste of the urbanized territories, creation of transport - logistic schemes on the transportation of garbage to the places of their necessary further processing, is offered. The system approach feature consists in the preliminary analysis of factors on the basis of which a more probable composition and volume of municipal solid waste is defined and the system of cleaning of municipal solid waste from the concrete urbanized territory is developed. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

One of the classical city problems is the habits of its people who do not care about cleanliness of their environment. Awareness of how to throw and manage garbage in a good manner is still not become an important consideration. The government doesn't have yet the efficient waste management system. Waste management system based on information technology capable of handling waste management problems is needed to overcome this problems. In this work, a prototype of waste management system has been developed, especially for the solid waste, focusing on segregation and garbage collection phase. The system consists of three main subsystems: the hardware subsystem consist of trash bin equipped with sensors and communication system for monitoring the garbage status and controlling the garbage collection schedule. The other subsystems are data management and data visualization subsystem for management and analysis purposes. The prototype was built and tested. It shows that the system can operate well, their sensors can detect different type of garbage, also can send and display the garbage status to the management display station. The prototype can meet the needs that have been defined as part of urban waste management solution. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Active urbanisation and industrialisation in Malaysia causing massive waste generation. Depleting of landfills is pushing for a new effective approach to solid waste management which is equally important in ensuring the environment is taken care of and free from pollution. Recently the Malaysian government decides to step up in a new holistic approach to a better waste management system where the new implementation of sorting and separation of waste according to a waste composition such as recyclable waste, residual waste and bulky/garden waste at source. This implementation in which requires people to separate their waste and sort the recyclable waste according to categories such as plastic, metal, paper and others. The idea to design and build an automatic waste sorting recycle bin is to support the initiative to separate different kind of trash according to specific categories at the early stage which is at domestic user such as at home and office.

abstract={Wadi Feiran basin is one of the most promising areas in southern Sinai (Egypt) for establishing new communities and for growth in agriculture, tourism, and industry. The present challenges against development include water runoff hazards (flash flooding), the increasing water demand, and water scarcity and contamination. These challenges could be mitigated by efficient use of runoff and rainwater through appropriate management, thereby promoting sustainable development. Strategies include the mitigation of runoff hazards and promoting the natural and artificial recharge of aquifers. This study uses a watershed modeling system, geographic information system, and classification scheme to predict the effects of various mitigation options on the basin’s water resources. Rainwater-harvesting techniques could save more than 77% of the basin’s runoff (by volume), which could be used for storage and aquifer recharge. A guide map is provided that shows possible locations for the proposed mitigation options in the study basin. Appropriate measures should be undertaken urgently: mitigation of groundwater contamination (including effective sewage effluent management); regular monitoring of the municipal, industrial and agricultural processes that release contaminants; rationalization and regulation of the application of agro-chemicals to farmland; and regular monitoring of contaminants in groundwater. Stringent regulations should be implemented to prevent wastewater disposal to the aquifers in the study area. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Time-resolved elemental analysis of particulate matter (PM) helps in the reliable identification of specific source tracers and study of mixing dynamics in the lower atmosphere. In this study, a new flow system (FS) for the introduction of samples into the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) instrument, which consists of on-line filtration and acidification of samples collected by a particle-into-liquid sampler (PILS), was optimised. Through this system, the limits of detection and quantification were significantly reduced, compared to those of ICP-MS analysis of samples collected by a PILS after off-line filtration. This makes it possible to conduct multi-elemental analysis of the samples collected by the PILS without any pre-treatment. The optimised FS-ICP-MS system was directly coupled with a PILS in order to study the profiles of some selected indoor and outdoor sources of PM (cigarette smoking, incense burning, brushwood burning, pellet burning, and road dust resuspension). The application of the FS-ICP-MS system for off-line elemental analysis of samples collected by a PILS during spot events in indoor and outdoor environments allowed us to verify the suitability of this system for the time-resolved (10 min) analysis of PM. The results indicate a significant increase in the indoor concentrations of some toxic elements (such as, Cd, and Pb) during the cleaning operation of domestic biomass burning systems (pellet stoves and thermo-fireplaces). Similarly, increases in the concentration of these elements were also observed in the outdoor environment during spot events of agricultural waste combustion, an illegal activity frequently practiced in many rural areas. © 2018 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control},

abstract={Optimum municipal solid waste (MSW) management system is an essential aspect to be considered. Optimal MSW management system could incur high cost of investment related to its construction, operation, and maintenance. The optimal configurations of the technologies within the system are of high importance, especially in developing countries due to the limitation on financial support. There are still limited studies on the integration of the possible configurations of the selected MSW management, which are centralized, clustered, and decentralized, in addition to location planning. A cost optimization model with the consideration of location planning is developed to identify the optimal configuration of the MSW management system with technologies considered such as landfilling, composting, refuse derived fuel, and reuse and recycling. The configuration considered in the study includes a centralized system, where all waste is gathered in a specific location and treated. The second configuration is the clustered system, where zones are identified, and waste treatment center is built in each zone. Finally, the decentralized, where smaller treatment centers are built at each village. The case study took place at the Desoq District, Kafr El Sheikh, Egypt. It is inhabited with a population of about 0.5 M capita. Fifteen scenarios are generated to account for the different combination of system configurations and the type of waste treatment and disposal unit. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed to perform the optimization. The results showed that increasing in the type and degree of treatment increases the net profit. This means that the incorporation of sorting, recycling, composting and RDF production leads to higher profit compared to landfilling only. The centralized systems turned out to attain more net profit than decentralized and clustered systems. The optimum scenario with maximum net profit value was the centralized system with sorting, composting, waste to energy facilities, and one landfill with a net profit of 3.864 USD/t/d. The optimal location for such centralized system is identified to be located beside Desoq wastewater treatment plant and between Desoq and Sanhour cities. The same model can be applied to other rural areas in developing countries. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Managing municipal solid waste is a major concern for cities around the world. Particularly urban communities with developing economies are urged to improve their waste management practices, and set up appropriate waste management systems. Waste management is a city-specific topic; there is no ideal solution that can be operationalized everywhere. In developing cities, municipalities and decision makers need simple and effective indicators to assess the sustainability of their current waste management systems, and set a performance reference point. The current study investigates available literature and suggests a list of measurable sustainability indicators which are specific to solid-waste management. The list encompasses 27 indicators that cover the building blocks of an integrated solid-waste management system, i.e., collection and sorting, recycling, composting, energy recovery, and landfilling. An assessment tool is developed through a five-point Likert scale, evaluating these indicators. Case studies of Cairo and Brussels were analyzed. The outcomes of this analysis can be used as a benchmark on a local level in planning, clarifying policy objectives, and setting priorities. © 2017, Springer Japan KK.},

abstract={The aim of this study is to analyse the evolution of the municipal solid waste management system of João Pessoa (Brazil), which was one of the Brazilian pioneers cities in implementing door-to-door selective collection programmes, in order to analyse the effect of policy decisions adopted in last decade with regard to selective collection. To do it, this study focuses on analysing the evolution, from 2005 to 2015, of the environmental performance of the municipal solid waste management (MSWM) system implemented in different sorting units with selective collection programmes by applying the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology and using as a starting point data collected directly from the different stakeholders involved in the MSWM system. This article presents the temporal evolution of environmental indicators measuring the environmental performance of the MSWM system implemented in João Pessoa by sorting unit, for each stage of the life cycle of the waste (collection, classification, intermediate transports, recycling and landfilling), for each waste fraction and for each collection method (selective collection or mixed collection), with the aim of identifying the key aspects with the greatest environmental impact and their causes. Results show on one hand, that environmental behaviour of waste management in a door-to-door selective collection programme significantly improves the behaviour of the overall waste management system. Consequently, the potential to reduce the existing environmental impact based on citizens’ increased participation in selective collection is evidenced, so the implementation of awareness-raising campaigns should be one of the main issues of the next policies on solid waste. On the other hand, increasing the amount of recyclable wastes collected selectively, implementing alternative methods for valorising the organic fraction (compost/biomethanization) and improving the efficiency of the transportation stage by means of optimizing vehicles or routes, are essential actions to reduce the overall net environmental impact generated by the MSWM system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Lake Burullus is one of the most important coastal lakes in Egypt. They are subject to industrial waste as well as agricultural and household effluents. The modern foraminifera was used to reflect the health of the ecosystem they inhabit. This paper used a Neutrosophic Rule-based Classification System (NRCS) to predict the pollution status of Burullus lagoon according to the concentrations of trace metals. The proposed system was trained by different ecological parameters which were chosen by a geological expert. Thirty samples of surface sediments were collected from Lake Burullus to assess the responsiveness of the fuaminvera bottom trace metal elements. Some samples were used for training the NRCS model (based on different selected geological parameters), while the other samples were kept hidden for testing the efficiency of the system. Several experiments have been done to validate the performance of the NRCS system. Three different sets of ecological parameters were tested by NRCS which showed high prediction accuracy results for the three types of parameters, 92%, 93% and 100%, respectively. Also, the NRCS showed advances compared to other well-known classifiers for all the three sets of parameters. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Municipal waste formation and management are contemporary issues in a modern world. Residents' participation is very important trying to utilize and recycle it because municipal waste is mainly generated by households'. For this reason, waste collection and sorting at home becomes crucial starting point solving problems created by waste. Aiming to examine what encourages households to sort waste we analysed following: (i) is it enough to create waste sorting system to encourage households to sort waste or (ii) waste sorting habits depend on lifestyle, environmental awareness and socio-demographic characteristics, or (iii) there is a need to introduce economic incentives to stimulate waste sorting. Theoretical analysis revealed that the main factors potentially affecting sorting habits are infrastructure at municipal level, economic instruments, socio-demographic characteristics and individual motivation. Empirical survey of Siauliai city households grounded on chi-square statistics and estimations of logistic regression showed that internal incentives and externally enabled conditions highly impact households' waste sorting behaviour. Moreover, results of the research clearly show that economic incentives embedded into existing waste management system are not strong enough to shape households' behaviour. © 2018 University of Pardubice.

abstract={When dealing with practical applications of hyperspectral imaging, the development of efficient, fast and flexible classification algorithms is of the utmost importance. Indeed, the optimal classification method should be able, in a reasonable time, to maximise the separation between the classes of interest and, at the same time, to correctly reject possible outlier samples. To this aim, a new extension of Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), namely Soft PLS-DA, has been implemented. The basic engine of Soft PLS-DA is the same as PLS-DA, but class assignment is subjected to some additional criteria which allow samples not belonging to the target classes to be identified and rejected. The proposed approach was tested on a real case study of plastic waste sorting based on near infrared hyperspectral imaging. Household plastic waste objects made of the six recyclable plastic polymers commonly used for packaging were collected and imaged using a hyperspectral camera mounted on an industrial sorting system. In addition, paper and not recyclable plastics were also considered as potential foreign materials that are commonly found in plastic waste. For classification purposes, the Soft PLS-DA algorithm was integrated into a hierarchical classification tree for the discrimination of the different plastic polymers. Furthermore, Soft PLS-DA was also coupled with sparse-based variable selection to identify the relevant variables involved in the classification and to speed up the sorting process. The tree-structured classification model was successfully validated both on a test set of representative spectra of each material for a quantitative evaluation, and at the pixel level on a set of hyperspectral images for a qualitative assessment. © 2018 The Authors.},

abstract={Remote sensing of the Earth allows to receive information of medium, a high spatial resolution from space vehicles and to conduct hyperspectral measurements. In many cases, waste disposal sites (WDS) is not legal. So, it is very important to use the system for automatic detection such places using satellite images. In this paper, a model of the automated space monitoring system for the presence of waste disposal sites is developed. The proposed system includes the following blocks: A database of WDS; a subsystem for detecting unauthorized WDS; a subsystem for monitoring the design, operation and reclamation rules for existing WDS; a subsystem for estimating the parameters of the WDS and their impact on the environment; a subsystem of satellite monitoring. We propose a method of detecting high-rise buildings landfills, such as municipal dumps and solid waste, according to a radar image (the height of the ground level). For system design, we use the apparatus of discrete orthogonal transformations. The impact of the WDS influence on agricultural crops is analyzed, based on the data of the Earth remote space sensing based on the orthogonal transform. The purpose of the work is the modeling of an automated space monitoring system for the presence of waste disposal facilities using regularization method in the problem of filtering of space images from the noise stored in the archives. As a result, the proposed method demonstrates good accuracy in detection the solid waste disposal site on real satellite images. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

abstract={This paper describes sorting line technology modelling as a potential key element of waste management at the municipal level, which, however, does not mean final treatment but only waste pre-treatment as an integral part of waste management chain. The outputs of the presented model are used as one of the key inputs to the NERUDA tool. The NERUDA tool provides support for strategic decision making in the field of waste management. The computational system of NERUDA has been created as an open tool and it is still being developed and expanded to suit current research tasks. The key part of NERUDA is a waste management related logistic problem. Hereafter, the NERUDA tool consists of a number of sub-modules and components that represent waste management technologies and procedures. Excessive separation not coupled with utilization of recyclables in the market can significantly disadvantage the overall economics of the chain. For the reason, a techno-economic model that can establish a representative waste treatment cost in order to obtain a valuable secondary raw material has been developed. Combination of techno-economic models allows to prepare unique, comprehensive and high-quality case studies. Various technological arrangements of sorting line, attainable rates of material separation and potential for subsequent energy recovery are considered. It is also appropriate to consider related costs of sorted waste collection, which may be a very economically demanding issue in overall waste processing balance. Positive selling price of secondary raw materials on the market is an assumption in addition to processing prices estimation. The model can serve as a useful tool for costs estimating (investment, profits). Furthermore, the model can serve as a key tool for feasibility studies in the context of sorting systems and the secondary raw material production over the lifetime of facilities. The practical contribution of described model is presented through a case study in the conditions of the Czech waste management. Copyright © 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.},

abstract={The urban household solid waste (HSW) classification and recycling system is a complex adaptive system (CAS), containing multiple agents and the behaviors between them are interactive. In order to figure out which is the most effective waste management policy for the HSW classification and recycling, this study tried to establish a simulation model combining multi-agent based simulation (MABS) techniques with a social survey questionnaire. The model can simulate the behavior change of the agents in the system under different policy scenarios. Then the proposed model is utilized in Suzhou city in eastern China. The system contains three main agents: (1) the resident agents that generate the HSW, (2) the recycling site and scavenger agents that collect the recyclable materials (paper, metal, plastics and etc.) in the household garbage, (3) the agents in the sanitation department (incineration power plants and landfills) that is responsible for the municipal solid waste collection and terminal garbage disposal. In addition, three waste charge policy scenarios are set and relevant simulation experiments are carried out. The results show that the specific charge policy can improve the performance of residents’ separation behavior, which is a more effective way to reduce the HSW and increase the collection rate of domestic recyclable resources (DRR). And there exists certain benefit conflicts between the environmental sanitation agent and the DRR recycling agent at the present stage in Suzhou city. To resolve the issue of the urban HSW management in China, it is necessary to balance the profit of charge point of agents in the system. In addition, it needs to combine the municipal garbage collection network and the renewable resource recycling network together. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The recycling of packaging waste is an important part of the EU circular economy package, with a political focus on raising the recycling targets for post-consumer plastic packaging waste (PPW). The recycling of PPW involves at least three steps; collection, sorting and mechanical recycling. In contrast to the first two steps, mechanical recycling is poorly documented, as it is considered a free market activity. In order to provide a complete chain description the mechanical recycling yields were determined. The recovery of mass was determined for the main plastic sorting products from both major collection systems: separate collection (SC) and mechanical recovery (MR) from municipal solid waste. This technical assessment was conducted with a laboratory set-up for a standard mechanical recycling process. This analysis showed that there is a substantial sample-to-sample variation in polymeric composition between similar feedstocks and this variation is also observed in recovered masses. Next, the mechanical recycling of polyethylene feedstocks was studied more in depth. Six PE feedstocks with a gradual increasing level of complexity (from only transparent PE bottle bodies to the complete PE sorting product according to DKR 329), were prepared and mechanical recycled with the laboratory set-up. Since the polymeric composition of both the six feedstocks and the six floating milled goods were known, the net PE recycling yield could be calculated. The net PE yields are close to 100% for such a standard recycling process. Additionally, the compositional analysis revealed that contaminants are only partially removed by the standard mechanical recycling process. © 2017 Author(s).},

abstract={Background: The use of landfills as containment for municipal solid waste management has received wide acceptance the world over. Its development in countries like Nigeria is constrained by high cost and scarcity of synthetic liners in the local markets. Exploration of the abundant locally available clay deposits in the country’s sedimentary Basins will prove economical, provided it satisfies the standard specifications for design and construction of landfill liners. Purpose: This study thus evaluates the suitability of shales from three formations (Enugu, Ameki and Imo) within Anambra Basin of Southeastern Nigeria as liner materials. Method: Geotechnical tests such as particle size distribution, Atterberg’s limits, compaction, coefficient of permeability and consolidation were performed on the shale samples. Geochemical analyses involving the inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICPES) and cation exchange capacity (CEC) were also conducted; all employing standard methods. Results: Based on the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS), Enugu and Imo shales contain high-plastic inorganic clay, while Ameki shales comprise low–medium-plastic inorganic clay. Coefficient of permeability result ranging from 9.12 × 10−6 to 2.14 × 10−6 cm/s indicates an increase above the standard specification. Expectedly, the cation exchange capacity (CEC), compressibility and plasticity index of the shales are positively related suggesting strong influence of the geotechnical properties on their sorption potentials. Overall assessment revealed that the high hydraulic conductivity and swelling potentials of the shales are not suitable for natural clay liners. Nevertheless, Enugu and Imo shales can further be stabilized chemically to the desired hydraulic conductivity of liners considering other suitable geotechnical properties and their CECs. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={There has been a significant rise in municipal solid waste (MSW) generation in the last few decades due to rapid urbanization and industrialization. Due to the lack of source segregation practice, a need for automated segregation of recyclables from MSW exists in the developing countries. This paper reports a thermal imaging based system for classifying useful recyclables from simulated MSW sample. Experimental results have demonstrated the possibility to use thermal imaging technique for classification and a robotic system for sorting of recyclables in a single process step. The reported classification system yields an accuracy in the range of 85–96% and is comparable with the existing single-material recyclable classification techniques. We believe that the reported thermal imaging based system can emerge as a viable and inexpensive large-scale classification-cum-sorting technology in recycling plants for processing MSW in developing countries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={When assessing the environmental and human health impact of a municipal food waste (FW) management system waste managers typically rely on the principles of the waste hierarchy; using metrics such as the mass or rate of waste that is ‘prepared for recycling,’ ‘recovered for energy,’ or ‘sent to landfill.’ These metrics measure the collection and sorting efficiency of a waste system but are incapable of determining the efficiency of a system to turn waste into a valuable resource. In this study a life cycle approach was employed using a system boundary that includes the entire waste service provision from collection to safe end-use or disposal. A life cycle inventory of seven waste management systems was calculated, including the first service wide inventory of FW management through kitchen in-sink disposal (food waste disposer). Results describe the mass, energy and water balance of each system along with key emissions profile. It was demonstrated that the energy balance can differ significantly from its’ energy generation, exemplified by mechanical biological treatment, which was the best system for generating energy from waste but only 5th best for net-energy generation. Furthermore, the energy balance of kitchen in-sink disposal was shown to be reduced because 31% of volatile solids were lost in pre-treatment. The study also confirmed that higher FW landfill diversion rates were critical for reducing many harmful emissions to air and water. Although, mass-balance analysis showed that the alternative end-use of the FW material may still contain high impact pollutants. © 2017},

abstract={This article presents a mini review of research aimed at understanding material recovery from municipal solid waste. It focuses on two areas, waste sorting behaviour and collection systems, so that research on the link between these areas could be identified and evaluated. The main results presented and the methods used in the articles are categorised and appraised. The mini review reveals that most of the work that offered design guidelines for waste management systems was based on optimising technical aspects only. In contrast, most of the work that focused on user involvement did not consider developing the technical aspects of the system, but was limited to studies of user behaviour. The only clear consensus among the articles that link user involvement with the technical system is that convenient waste collection infrastructure is crucial for supporting source separation. This mini review reveals that even though the connection between sorting behaviour and technical infrastructure has been explored and described in some articles, there is still a gap when using this knowledge to design waste sorting systems. Future research in this field would benefit from being multidisciplinary and from using complementary methods, so that holistic solutions for material recirculation can be identified. It would be beneficial to actively involve users when developing sorting infrastructures, to be sure to provide a waste management system that will be properly used by them. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={The rapid growth of household waste not only endangers the environment and people's health, but also limits social and economic development. The effective sorting and recycling of garbage can control this problem. Adopting a semi-quantitative case study method, our researchers investigated the effect of a bonus point system for refuse classification that improves the accuracy of refuse classification and the residents' environment awareness. In the system, residents will receive some gifts after sorting the garbage correctly. We also investigated the attitudes of residents and companies towards this novel system. Our researchers employed various methods to analyze garbage-sorting data, questionnaires completed by residents, and interview records. The results show that use of a bonus point system affects the management of domestic waste by improving the accuracy and enhancing the awareness of garbage sorting. Overall, residents support the system and benefit from it, which increases participation and consciousness of environmental protection. However, continuous publicity and coordination of various policies are required to promote the wide-range implementation and sustainable development of this system. © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={Assuming a duopoly market where the producers use packaging recyclability to vertically differentiated their product, we analyse the efficiency of an extended producer responsibility (EPR) to deliver optimal choices of packaging. In this paper, the EPR means that the producers bear the social disposal cost of packaging waste resulting from households’ consumption of their product. Disposal of household packaging waste comprises sorting and treatment operations. Therefore, the social disposal cost is the sum of both the sorting and the dumping costs. We confirm that an EPR is not an optimal policy, and then we show that an optimal policy couples an EPR to two bonus/penalty systems: the first one reduces the sorting cost borne by the producers, the second one affects the dumping cost borne by the producers. This optimal policy entails that the producers bear a disposal cost higher (respectively lower) than the social disposal cost when improving packaging recyclability is cost-reducing (respectively costly). © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={In the U.K., between 7.6 m3 to 76m3 of water is lost annually in each residence through leaks. In contrast to the ongoing improvement on water distribution network leakage detection technologies, research on water leakage at the domestic level has been limited. Identification of large flow rate leaks (i.e. L/min. with floods or bursts) through the analysis of the household water consumption is highly feasible. However, micro-flow rate leaks (i.e. mL/min.) tend to be overlooked and can therefore waste hundreds of liters of water before detection. This, alongside increasing awareness of water quality and resource protection, mandates further investigation of micro-leak detection systems. An innovative micro-leak detection system for domestic applications that utilizes an ultrasonic flowmeter in a new shunt configuration is proposed. Unlike conventional water leakage detection systems, the proposed automated system is highly sensitive (detected leaks of 1 mL/min.) and does not impede the main flow. The micro-leak detection system is completely automated as it employs a: USB-powered voltmeter, USB-powered flowmeter and USB-powered switches. An elegant feature is that the system is remotely controlled across the Globe; thus, allowing large-scale data collection and system control. This system circumvents water leaks on any scale, anywhere in the world. This latter feature is beyond the reach of the complex conventional detection methods. The de-noising property of Wavelet transform is carried out on the remotely collected data from the ultrasonic flowmeter to remove unwanted noise. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Rapid increase in volume and types of solid and hazardous waste due to continuous economic growth, urbanization and industrialization, is becoming a burgeoning problem for national and local governments to ensure effective and sustainable management of waste. It is estimated that in 2006 the total amount of municipal solid waste generated globally reached 2.02 billion tones, representing a 7% annual increase since 2003 (Global Waste Management Market Report 2007). The segregation, handling, transport, and disposal of waste needs to be properly managed to minimize the risk to the health and safety of patients, the public, and the environment. The economic value of waste is best realized when it is segregated. Currently, there is no such system of segregation of dry, wet and metallic wastes at the household level. This paper proposes an Automated Waste Segregator (AWS) which is a cheap, easy to use solution for a segregation system for household use, so that it can be sent directly for processing. It is designed to sort the refuse into metallic waste, wet waste and dry waste. The AWS employs parallel resonant impedance sensing mechanism to identify metallic items, and capacitive sensors to distinguish between wet and dry waste. Experimental results show that the segregation of waste into metallic, wet and dry waste has been successfully implemented using the AWS. © 2014 IEEE.},

A holistic treatment of the total wastewater flow comprising diverse material streams is very challenging due to a frequently changing product range. The developed concept provides a functional and yet simple approach by classifying material and wastewater streams that could be treated by distinct adapted processes.

abstract={The article contains the results of the ecological and hygienic diagnostics of conditions of lands of areas of different sizes and varying degrees of urbanization, located in different agro-climatic conditions of European Russia (the southern Astrakhan region, he city of Moscow). Assessments of the state of territories use a new approach to rationing of Hg according to quantitative ratios of the content of its thermoforms in soils, grounds and alluvium (in litho substrate). The method of diagnostics is based on known properties of Hg forms: their geochemical activity (migration mobility) and toxicity decline along with the increment of the Hg temperature threshold of the release in the process of continuous warming up of the litho substrate sample (up to 1100°C). Thermoforms are not tied to specific minerals or chemicals and are conditionally designated as FR (Free: <180°C), CL (Chloride: 180-250°C), FS and CS (physically and chemically sorbed: 250-400°C), SU (Sulfide: 400-500°C) IS (isomorphic: >500°C) Hg forms. Among forms, also conditionally according to complexes of low, medium and high temperature variations(FR + CL, FS + CS and SU + IZ, respectively, there are selected groups of «mobile», «sustainable» and «inert» forms. For technogenic Hg there is characterized the predominance in the sample of «mobile» and to lesser extent degree - «stable» thermoforms. The more intensive this predominance is, the higher is environmental hazard. The natural accumulation is diagnosed by the presence and prevalence of the sum of moderate - and high-temperature inert forms of Hg. According to the ratios of Hg content, its forms and groups, as well as the density of correlationships between them, 6 indices of the conditions of soils and alluvium were developed by ourselves.Main coefficients out of indices on informativeness of results of diagnostics are the following factors: Endogenous input, Geochemical activity and Hg mobility. With regard to the combination of variability in indices, the total amount of Hg, the genesis and intensity of its accumulation (natural or anthropogenic), there were also developed ranking scales of the ecological and hygienic condition of the land areas and surface water bodies. As a result, on the base of such approach to the regulation of Hg the information value of assessments of mercury contamination of land significantly increased. At the objects of assessments there were identified following areas: foci of the manifestation of Hg hypolimnetic emanations on the landscape surface - dispersion halos in the areas of the Earth crust fracture (the dome of the Astrakhan gas condensate field); environmentally dangerous (sometimes even at a low total content of Hg) parts of cities, towns, their districts, as well as beds of watercourses and water reservoirs bottom (the Volga river valley and delta, the Lefortovo quarter in Moscow). There was also diagnosed the threshold of the background distribution of gross Hg content detected = 0.2-0.3 mg/kg. Its magnitude is consistent with domestic and abroad safe levels of Hg accumulation in soils = 0.3-0.4 mg/kg. The approach provides the differentiation of the environmental hazard lands. Technology of the approach can be used in the development of normative Document for the diagnosis of environmental and sanitary condition of territories in the system of Classifications of hazard of waste, in decontamination of territories, water areas and land zoning according to the criteria of natural or anthropogenic Hg accumulation. © 2017 Izdatel'stvo Meditsina.

abstract={Recycling of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) is important, not only to reduce the amount of waste requiring treatment, but also to promote the recovery of valuable materials as well as the responsible elimination of its hazardous components and compounds. One of key issues in plastic recycling is identification of plastics containing brominated flame retardants (BFRs), which should not enter recycling products. There are technologies that can identify the plastics with BFRs, however, none of this is practiced for WEEE or e-waste. In the present study, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) technique is used to identify and sort the plastics with BFRs recovered from the used small household appliances such as an electric cooker, a vacuum cleaner, an air cleaner, etc. LIBS is a form of atomic emission spectroscopy which is typically performed using a pulsed laser to create a surface ablation on a sample which is then analyzed spectroscopically for its elemental and molecular composition. LIBS also has its own set of advantages such as it is able to detect black plastics. The present communication gives a brief review of the current status of the development on lab-scale automatic sensing system for identification and sorting of plastics obtained from the used small household appliances. © The Mining and Materials Processing Institute of Japan},

abstract={Small household appliances (small HH), such as vacuum cleaner, electric cooker, and air cleaner among others, are diverse and complex given their materials and components, as well as the waste streams from the manufacturing processes. The plastic concentration in used small HH is particularly high compared to that of large HH. A great variety of plastics is used in small HH, and such differ not only by plastic type but also by color and presence of additives. Different separation technologies, such as optical sorting, gravity and electrostatic separation, and flotation, are widely used for recovering plastics from municipal wastes, e-scraps, and so on. Near-infrared ray (NIR) sensors are particularly used for separating plastics by resin type at high throughputs. However, one of the shortcomings of NIR sensors is its inability to detect black plastics. This study developed an automatic sorting system based on a new sensing system to classify black plastics obtained from used small HH. To reduce data dimensions, spectrum data were preprocessed by adopting principal component analysis and by treating with a classifier, which was designed with artificial intelligence algorithm. Results of the lab-scale automatic sorting system for sorting black plastics by type are discussed. ©The Mining and Materials Processing Institute of Japan},

This paper describes a case of introduction of such a system at a university of applied sciences (UAS) in Tallinn. The project started in September 2015. The main goals of the project were to reduce the number of garbage cans in the UAS, reduce the amount of unsorted household waste and inform the school community about the significance of waste sorting and relevant environmental matters. The first step of the project was to execute a full waste audit in UAS to identify precise waste quantities which occurred on daily basis. During the week the environmental technology students weighed and sorted all the waste in all premises of the UAS. Based on the collected data, the new system comprised of 19 waste collection points with sorting instructions and adequate volume. The total number of garbage cans was reduced by 46% and mixed household garbage cans by 72%. The final step was to analyse the efficiency of the new waste collection arrangements. Results showed that the new system was well accepted and 80-85% of waste was sorted and collected in the new waste collection points. © 2017 Monica Vilms, Oliver Kalda. Published by VGTU Press.},

abstract={In the design and construction of landfill leachate collection and detection systems, it is important to maintain adequate drainage in order to minimize the hydraulic head on both primary and secondary liner systems. This is reflected in minimizing the leakage through the liner system. The situation is heightened when wet (also called bioreactor) landfilling is practiced in order to have rapid degradation of the organics as opposed to traditional dry landfilling. Concern has been expressed over such aggressive liquid management practices in bioreactor landfilling in regard to the long term clogging of geocomposites in either the leachate collection or leak detection systems of double lined municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. In order to evaluate different geocomposite drainage systems we tested several per the GRI-GC1 Standard, "Test Method for Soil-Filter Core Combined Flow Test". These experiments were conducted for three years in a field laboratory at a major MSW landfill in the U.S.A. The investigation was conducted until system permeability reached equilibrium. It was found that the tubular geocomposite performed well over time. Good performance was predicated on proper geotextile filter selection with this particular leachate and set of environmental conditions. Conclusions and recommendations as to various possible drainage geocomposites and their behavior are presented. © ASCE.},

abstract={Waste is not a rejected item to dispose anymore but increasingly a secondary resource to exploit, influencing waste allocation among treatment operations in a waste management (WM) system. The aim of this methodological paper is to present a new method for the assessment of the WM system, the “analytical method of the waste allocation process” (AMWAP), based on the concept of the “waste allocation process” defined as the aggregation of all processes of apportioning waste among alternative waste treatment operations inside or outside the spatial borders of a WM system. AMWAP contains a conceptual framework and an analytical approach. The conceptual framework includes, firstly, a descriptive model that focuses on the description and classification of the WM system. It includes, secondly, an explanatory model that serves to explain and to predict the operation of the WM system. The analytical approach consists of a step-by-step analysis for the empirical implementation of the conceptual framework. With its multiple purposes, AMWAP provides an innovative and objective modular method to analyse a WM system which may be integrated in the framework of impact assessment methods and environmental systems analysis tools. Its originality comes from the interdisciplinary analysis of the WAP and to develop the conceptual framework. AMWAP is applied in the framework of an illustrative case study on the household WM system of Geneva (Switzerland). It demonstrates that this method provides an in-depth and contextual knowledge of WM. © 2016},

abstract={Chlorinated benzenes are typical precursors and indicators for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) emissions from waste incinerators. Online and real-time monitoring of chlorobenzenes is a challenge due to their low concentration and complex nature of the flue gas. In this work, a continuous online monitoring system was built for detection of trace chlorinated benzenes based on a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOFMS). A single photon ionization (SPI) source based on a radiofrequency-excited windowless vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) lamp was developed for the first time to eliminate the signal attenuation resulting from the contamination of magnesium fluoride windows and to avoid the fragment ions. An automatic enrichment system including three parallel Tenax TA adsorption tubes was designed and coupled to the TOFMS to achieve the required ultrahigh sensitivity. The limits of quantitation at 7.65, 5.37 and 6.77 pptv were obtained for monochlorobenzene (MCBz), dichlorobenzene (DCBz) and trichlorobenzene (TrCBz), respectively, within a 29-min analytical period. Moreover, this apparatus was applied to continuously online monitor the actual flue gas from a waste incinerator for three months. During this period, the concentrations of MCBz, DCBz and TrCBz detected in the flue gas were in the range of 100–1200, 50–800 and 50–300 pptv, respectively. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of the sensitivity for the windowless VUV lamp ion source was 9.71% evaluated by the internal standard benzene over the 3-months flue gas monitoring. These results demonstrated the capability of this method in long-term analysis of the trace chlorinated benzenes in the flue gas. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Policymakers apply various policy instruments to meet the objective of resource conservation in the framework of waste policy. The cantonal waste policy of Geneva implements this objective by focussing on sorting of household waste for recycling. Cantonal and municipal authorities use incentive instruments and a mix of infrastructural and persuasive instruments to develop waste sorting for households. However, they have so far failed to reach the objective of a recovery rate of 50% for household waste in Geneva. This study assesses recycling and sorting practices for household waste in Geneva as basis for the formulation of a new improved strategy. This interdisciplinary assessment combines a policy evaluation of the household waste management system over the period 2002–2013 with a situation analysis of the current household waste management practices through a SWOT analysis by using triangulation as the method of data collection. The results of policy evaluation show the effectiveness of incentive instruments (e.g., incineration tax) in encouraging the Genevan municipalities to implement and improve sorting infrastructures and services. Moreover, they demonstrate that a combination of infrastructural (e.g., collection points) and persuasive (e.g., awareness raising campaigns) instruments is effective for enhancing the Genevan household waste sorting practices under certain conditions. The situation analysis identifies the significant internal and external factors that have a positive or a negative influence on household waste sorting and recycling in Geneva. The outputs of the policy evaluation and situation analysis serve to formulate a strategy that is adapted to local specificities. This strategy highlights the necessity for policymakers to avoid unnecessary duplication of the sorting system among the stakeholders and the importance of national authorities for creating framework conditions to encourage the implementation of recycling sectors. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In this study, we investigate the usability of sound recognition for source separation of packaging wastes in reverse vending machines (RVMs). For this purpose, an experimental setup equipped with a sound recording mechanism was prepared. Packaging waste sounds generated by three physical impacts such as free falling, pneumatic hitting and hydraulic crushing were separately recorded using two different microphones. To classify the waste types and sizes based on sound features of the wastes, a support vector machine (SVM) and a hidden Markov model (HMM) based sound classification systems were developed. In the basic experimental setup in which only free falling impact type was considered, SVM and HMM systems provided 100% classification accuracy for both microphones. In the expanded experimental setup which includes all three impact types, material type classification accuracies were 96.5% for dynamic microphone and 97.7% for condenser microphone. When both the material type and the size of the wastes were classified, the accuracy was 88.6% for the microphones. The modeling studies indicated that hydraulic crushing impact type recordings were very noisy for an effective sound recognition application. In the detailed analysis of the recognition errors, it was observed that most of the errors occurred in the hitting impact type. According to the experimental results, it can be said that the proposed novel approach for the separation of packaging wastes could provide a high classification performance for RVMs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This study analyses the determinants of household recycling behaviour in a recycling system at an early stage of development (Lithuania) and compares them with those of a more mature recycling scheme (Sweden). The analysis builds on the empirics from household surveys and focuses on four fractions of household packaging waste. Several similarities within the two recycling schemes were found, including convenience, norm-based motivators, and the interactions between such factors. The analysis tested and confirmed the so-called ABC Hypothesis of moral norms being less important as motivators to recycle when it is easy and convenient to collect packaging waste, e.g. when kerbside collection is in place. One important difference between the two schemes was that social norms were found to be important for source sorting in the early-stage recycling system but not in the mature recycling system. This suggests not only that more effort should be devoted to shaping social norms that facilitate household recycling behaviour when collection systems are launched, but also that the focus should be on moral norms when the convenience factors in waste management schemes are still underdeveloped. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Increasing concern about climate change is prompting organisations to mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions. Waste management activities also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. In the waste management sector, there has been an increasing diversion of waste sent to landfill, with much emphasis on recycling and reuse to prevent emissions. This study evaluates the carbon footprint of the different processes involved in waste management systems, considering the entire waste management stream. Waste management data from the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, London (UK), was used to estimate the carbon footprint for its (Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames) current source segregation system. Second, modelled full and partial co-mingling scenarios were used to estimate carbon emissions from these proposed waste management approaches. The greenhouse gas emissions from the entire waste management system at Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames were 12,347 t CO2e for the source-segregated scenario, and 11,907 t CO2e for the partial co-mingled model. These emissions amount to 203.26 kg CO2e t-1 and 196.02 kg CO2e t-1 municipal solid waste for source-segregated and partial co-mingled, respectively. The change from a source segregation fleet to a partial co-mingling fleet reduced the emissions, at least partly owing to a change in the number and type of vehicles. © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={More efficient recycling of municipal solid waste (MSW) is an essential precondition for turning Europe into a circular economy. Thus, the recycling of MSW must increase significantly in several member states, including Finland. This has increased the interest in the composition of mixed MSW. Due to increased information needs, a method for mixed MSW composition studies was introduced in Finland in order to improve the national comparability of composition study results. The aim of this study was to further develop the method so that it corresponds to the information needed about the composition of mixed MSW and still works in practice.A survey and two mixed MSW composition studies were carried out in the study. According to the responses of the survey, the intensification of recycling, the landfill ban on organic waste and the producer responsibility for packaging waste have particularly influenced the need for information about the composition of mixed MSW. The share of biowaste in mixed MSW interested the respondents most. Additionally, biowaste proved to be the largest waste fraction in mixed MSW in the composition studies. It constituted over 40% of mixed MSW in both composition studies. For these reasons, the classification system of the method was updated by further defining the classifications of biowaste. The classifications of paper as well as paperboard and cardboard were also updated. The updated classification system provides more information on the share of avoidable food waste and waste materials suitable for recycling in mixed MSW. The updated method and the information gained from the composition studies are important in ensuring that the method will be adopted by municipal waste management companies and thus used widely in Finland. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Nowadays the mode of periodic maintenance and routine check are adopted as the dominating maintenance style of domestic aircraft. However, this mode requires a large number of experienced professionals, resulting in the waste of manpower and resources. In this paper, taking the flight data of a certain type of aircraft as the main data source, a fault diagnosis reasoning expert system based on failure mode is proposed through extracting the fault symptom information and the system failure mode. The main work of this system is as following: 1) In this system, The fault tree analysis (FTA) is adopted by the fault diagnosis expert system for fault detection of the aircraft. The FTA can reduce the difficulty of diagnostic reasoning and knowledge acquisition. By combining production-rules and the minimum cuts of the fault tree, the fault mode of the aircraft can be effectively extracted, An optimized reasoning engine is built based on the fault mode, which utilizes the forward reasoning pattern for logical inference. 2) A fault diagnosis expert system, which is based on failure mode, is developed with MFC frame by using MySQL as the database on the Windows 7 platform. This system has been successfully applied to a certain type of domestic aircraft. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Municipal solid waste (MSW) contains mineral materials which are seldom considered as a potential resource. Currently, the waste management sector pays attention to recyclable parts, biodegradable material, waste-to-energy fraction, and residues after waste reuse and recycle. In contrast, this study focus as on the mineral matter in MSW. The aim was to analyze and discuss the sources of mineral matter in MSW, the impact which the minerals have on waste management technologies, and finally, the possibility to recycle the mineral matter. The contribution of inorganic matter in the MSW stream is significant (about 20 wt.%). In the years 2012-2015, the average content of mineral matter in mixed MSW in Poland ranged from 16 wt.% to 36 wt.%, and the content of organic in MSW ranged from 20 wt.% to 42 wt.%. Minerals in MSW have rather negative impact on waste management technologies and their final products, and can be sorted out from the MSW stream, either in the households or in a central sorting line. However, in central collection and separation systems it is difficult to obtain a mineral matter fraction in subsequent processing steps due to technological limitations (inefficiency of devices), high degree of waste fragmentation and pollution of mineral matter with other waste. This indicates a hampered ability to separate minerals in a form available for reuse, so an effective system should be based on improved segregation at the source.},

abstract={Municipal solid waste (MSW), generated at an unprecedented rate due to rapid urbanization and industrialization contains useful recyclable materials like metals, plastic, wood, etc. Recycling of useful materials from MSW in the developing countries is severely constrained by limited door-to-door collection and poor means of segregation. Recovery of recyclables is usually performed by waste pickers, which is highly risky and hazardous for their health. This paper reports the development of a robotic mobile manipulation system for automated sorting of useful recyclables from MSW. The developed robot is equipped with a thermal imaging camera, proximity sensor and a 5-DOF robotic arm. This paper presents an approach for sorting based on automated identification from thermographic images. The developed algorithm extracts keypoint features from the thermographic image and feeds into clustering model to map them into a bag-of-word vectors. Finally, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used for identifying the recyclable material. We used the developed algorithm to detect three categories of recyclables namely, aluminum can, plastic bottle and tetra pack from given thermographic images. We obtained classification rate of 94.3% in the tests. In future, we plan to extend the developed approach for classifying a wider range of recyclable objects as well as to incorporate motion planning algorithms to handle cluttered environments.

abstract={Mixed municipal solid waste currently landfilled contains a high percentage of packaging glass, varying from 33% to 80% by weight according to several sample characterizations, due to the lack of high throughput separation technology. The hydrodynamic separator proposed is a closed-loop device developed to separate co-mingled waste into plastics, glass and other dense particles and organic sludge. The glass and other dense material stream is cleaned by the system, permitting efficient downstream optical sorting to take out metals and ceramics and, if required, glass sorted by colour. The plastics and the organic sludge are separate, processable waste streams. As the solid waste is introduced in the separator, the action of water jets located on the ramps of a fixed sinusoidal-shape bottom and the presence of hydrofoils at the upper part of the tank produce a flow pattern that lead plastics towards its collection point on the surface, while glass and ceramics are settled to the bottom of the tank and transported to the extraction point. Organics and other fine particles are obtained from lamellas, before reintroducing the clarified fluid into the flow loop. The sludge obtained from this process is suitable for feedstock to Anaerobic Digestion processes. In the present paper the equipment and the methodology is described and the physical principles of the separation process are explained. Results from a full scale trial designed to process 9.7 tonnes per hour at a municipal UK waste site operating in Nov 2015 - Feb 2016 are presented. © 2016 WIT Press.},
