Abstract = {{Source separation systems for the management of domestic wastewater and
   food waste has been suggested as more sustainable sanitation systems for
   urban areas. The present study used an attributional life cycle
   assessment to investigate the carbon footprint and potential for
   nutrient recovery of two sanitation systems for a hypothetical urban
   area in Southern Sweden. The systems represented a typical Swedish
   conventional system and a possible source separation system with
   increased nutrient recovery. The assessment included the management
   chain from household collection, transport, treatment and final return
   of nutrients to agriculture or disposal of the residuals. The results
   for carbon footprint and nutrient recovery (phosphorus and nitrogen)
   concluded that the source separation system could increase nutrient
   recovery (0.30-0.38 kg P capita(-1) year(-1) and 3.10-3.28 kg N
   capita(-1) year(-1) while decreasing the carbon footprint (-24 to -58 kg
   CO2-eq. capita(-1) year(-1)), compared to the conventional system. The
   nutrient recovery was increased by the use of struvite precipitation and
   ammonium stripping at the wastewater treatment plant. The carbon
   footprint decreased, mainly due to the increased biogas production,
   increased replacement of mineral fertilizer in agriculture and less
   emissions of nitrous oxide from wastewater treatment. In conclusion, the
   study showed that source separation systems could potentially be used to
   increase nutrient recovery from urban areas, while decreasing the
   climate impact. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the U.K., between 7.6 m(3) to 76m(3) of water is lost annually in
   each residence through leaks. In contrast to the ongoing improvement on
   water distribution network leakage detection technologies, research on
   water leakage at the domestic level has been limited. Identification of
   large flow rate leaks (i.e. Llmin. with floods or bursts) through the
   analysis of the household water consumption is highly feasible. However,
   micro-flow rate leaks (i.e. mL/min.) tend to be overlooked and can
   therefore waste hundreds of liters of water before detection. This,
   alongside increasing awareness of water quality and resource protection,
   mandates further investigation of micro-leak detection systems. An
   innovative micro-leak detection system for domestic applications that
   utilizes an ultrasonic flowmeter in a new shunt configuration is
   proposed. Unlike conventional water leakage detection systems, the
   proposed automated system is highly sensitive (detected leaks of 1
   mL/min.) and does not impede the main flow. The micro-leak detection
   system is completely automated as it employs a: USB-powered voltmeter,
   USB-powered flowmeter and USB-powered switches. An elegant feature is
   that the system is remotely controlled across the Globe; thus, allowing
   large-scale data collection and system control. This system circumvents
   water leaks on any scale, anywhere in the world. This latter feature is
   beyond the reach of the complex conventional detection methods. The
   de-noising property of Wavelet transform is carried out on the remotely
   collected data from the ultrasonic flowmeter to remove unwanted noise.}},

Abstract = {{The present research provides a quantitative assessment of households'
   preferences for different waste separation and handling schemes. We
   employ a choice-experiment based, nation-wide survey across Denmark. The
   findings support four different types of ``waste sorters{''}; reflecting
   the heterogeneity in household waste sorting preferences. To illustrate,
   while one segment responds favourably towards sorting systems with the
   possibility for local collection points for hazardous waste and for
   sorting bio-waste, some segments express opposite responses. We found
   statistically significant relationships between the heterogeneity in
   household preferences for home waste sorting and households'
   sociodemographic characteristics, current self-reported time allocation
   for waste sorting and handling, use of recycling facilities as well as
   attitudinal factors on personal motivation and social influence.
   Furthermore, the findings reveal trade-offs between households' waste
   sorting preferences and the amount of time they have to spend sorting.
   We estimate a value of time for this pro-environmental activity of
   between 2.8 and 6.3 EUR per hour. Overall, the present research
   demonstrates that households express different preferences towards the
   practical design of waste sorting systems. This needs to be considered
   in the development of policy initiatives in order to achieve more
   effective sorting systems through higher rates of compliance from the
   public at large.}},

   investigates the drivers behind the decision of stakeholders to

   previously existing pilot areas in the decision-making process. By means
   of semi-structured expert interviews, five areas with source separation
   were characterized and compared. It was found that the most important
   drivers were on the one hand governmental, especially local
   environmental goals and on the other hand the ambition of the utilities
   to gain knowledge about future wastewater management and treatment
   technologies. Experiences from existing smaller pilot areas were shown
   crucial for decisions to implement the larger pilot areas that are
   currently planned, as was intensive stakeholder co-operation, due to the
   fact that source separation systems transcend traditional boundaries
   between energy, waste and water sectors. The results hold implications
   for policy makers and municipalities initiating a transition to more

Abstract = {{There has been a significant rise in municipal solid waste (MSW)

   Experimental results have demonstrated the possibility to use thermal
   imaging technique for classification and a robotic system for sorting of
   recyclables in a single process step. The reported classification system
   yields an accuracy in the range of 85-96\% and is comparable with the
   existing single-material recyclable classification techniques. We
   believe that the reported thermal imaging based system can emerge as a
   viable and inexpensive large-scale classification-cum-sorting technology

Abstract = {{Management of municipal solid waste is an efficient method to increase
   resource efficiency, as well as to replace fossil fuels with renewable
   energy sources due to that (1) waste to a large extent is renewable as
   it consists of food waste, paper, wood etc. and (2) when energy and
   materials are recovered from waste treatment, fossil fuels can be
   substituted. In this paper results from a comprehensive system study of
   future biological treatment of readily degradable waste in two Swedish
   regions are presented. Different collection and separation systems for
   food waste in households have been applied as well as technical
   improvements of the biogas process as to reduce environmental impact.
   The results show that central sorting of a mixed fraction into
   recyclables, combustibles, biowaste and inert is a competitive option
   compared to source separation. Use of pellets is beneficial compared to
   direct spreading as fertiliser. Fuel pellets seem to be the most
   favourable option, which to a large extent depends on the circumstances
   in the energy system. Separation and utilisation of nitrogen in the wet
   part of the digestion residue is made possible with a number of
   technologies which decreases environmental impact drastically, however
   to a substantial cost in some cases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   a MSW disposal plant. Among the detected volatile compounds (VCs), the
   top ten odor compounds were methanethiol, dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{With an increased focus on recycling, local authorities need to adapt
   their systems for curbside collection of household waste to accommodate
   an increased degree of sorting of waste types. Therefore, it is
   essential to study the transport aspects of waste collection. In this
   paper, we analyze the driving requirements for curbside collection of
   household waste for different systems in the context of Denmark. We
   consider a Collect, then sort system, as opposed to two Sort, then
   collect systems using single and multi-compartment vehicles, and compare
   the systems among themselves, and to the collection for incineration
   system. Our approach consists of solving the underlying capacitated arc
   routing problems of each system, and comparing the transport
   requirements in terms of driven distance and number of routes across
   systems. Our findings show that an increased degree of sorting is
   synonymous with a significant increase in the driven distance and the
   number of routes. Moreover, we find that the sort, then collect by
   multi-compartment vehicles system outperforms the others in terms of
   driven distance, and that the sort, then collect by single compartment
   vehicles system outperforms the others in terms of number of routes. We
   found that three cost drivers affect the overall results: the change in
   the size of the vehicle, the compression factor inside the vehicles'
   compartments, and the packing of the vehicles' compartments. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{In the design and construction of landfill leachate collection and
   detection systems, it is important to maintain adequate drainage in
   order to minimize the hydraulic head on both primary and secondary liner
   systems. This is reflected in minimizing the leakage through the liner
   system. The situation is heightened when wet (also called bioreactor)
   landfilling is practiced in order to have rapid degradation of the
   organics as opposed to traditional dry landfilling. Concern has been
   expressed over such aggressive liquid management practices in bioreactor
   landfilling in regard to the long term clogging of geocomposites in
   either the leachate collection or leak detection systems of double lined
   municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. In order to evaluate different
   geocomposite drainage systems we tested several per the GRI-GC1
   Standard, ``Test Method for Soil-Filter Core Combined Flow Test{''}.
   These experiments were conducted for three years in a field laboratory
   at a major MSW landfill in the U.S.A. The investigation was conducted
   until system permeability reached equilibrium. It was found that the
   tubular geocomposite performed well over time. Good performance was
   predicated on proper geotextile filter selection with this particular

Abstract = {{Municipal solid waste represents an increasing environmental issue in
   modern societies. In 2012, each individual in the European Union
   produced on average approximately 500 kg of municipal waste. One way of
   reducing this amount would be to separate the waste more. Theory
   identifies the availability of infrastructure for waste separation
   facilities as the most important factor affecting the willingness to
   separate. In this paper we compare the effects of two common systems of
   waste separation: drop-off collection represented by ``separation
   nests{''} and curbside collection represented by the sack collection. We
   follow the idea suggested by the previous research that if reaching the
   separation site requires less effort, people are more likely to separate
   their waste. Our results prove this. We show that with separation nests
   the amount of separated paper and plastics compared to total municipal
   solid waste is approximately 8-9\%; with a sack collection system added,
   the amount increases up to approximately 11-12\%. If we add a motivation
   factor in the form of rewards per amount of separated waste, the amount
   of separated paper and plastics increases up to 23\%. Additionally,
   higher density of separation nests has been also identified as a factor
   in increasing separation level. Our results prove that with more
   available separation sites, people are willing to separate more, and
   that certain waste separation systems can have dramatic impact on the
   overall separation rate. Such findings may be utilized by municipalities
   trying to increase their separation rates.}},

Abstract = {{In order to increase resource recovery from solid waste, better sorting
   of household waste is needed. This article reports on a case study about
   waste sorting infrastructure performance carried out in two buildings in
   Gothenburg, Sweden. Results from the study reveal mismatches between
   users' needs and what the system offers, affecting the sorting rates and
   quality of the sorted material. Frequent sorting errors were observed
   from the tenants in these apartment buildings, where more than 70\% of
   the discards that go in the mixed waste could be sorted out into other
   available fractions, with biodegradable waste being the most neglected.
   Hazardous waste was often discarded wrongly and recurrent errors were
   observed in the containers available for sorting different packaging
   material. Given the performance observed, initial suggestions are made
   for housing companies to rethink the sorting system they offer to their
   tenants (i.e. accessible space for electronic waste, more space for
   biodegradable waste, possibility of sorting textiles, etc.). Most
   importantly this paper makes the case that housing companies have the
   opportunity to provide sorting infrastructure that is designed for the
   user, rather than just fitted to the waste management system. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{More efficient recycling of municipal solid waste (MSW) is an essential
   precondition for turning Europe into a circular economy. Thus, the
   recycling of MSW must increase significantly in several member states,
   including Finland. This has increased the interest in the composition of
   mixed MSW. Due to increased information needs, a method for mixed MSW
   composition studies was introduced in Finland in order to improve the
   national comparability of composition study results. The aim of this
   study was to further develop the method so that it corresponds to the
   information needed about the composition of mixed MSW and still works in
   practice.
   A survey and two mixed MSW composition studies were carried out in the
   study. According to the responses of the survey, the intensification of
   recycling, the landfill ban on organic waste and the producer
   responsibility for packaging waste have particularly influenced the need
   for information about the composition of mixed MSW. The share of
   biowaste in mixed MSW interested the respondents most. Additionally,
   biowaste proved to be the largest waste fraction in mixed MSW in the
   composition studies. It constituted over 40\% of mixed MSW in both
   composition studies. For these reasons, the classification system of the
   method was updated by further defining the classifications of biowaste.
   The classifications of paper as well as paperboard and cardboard were
   also updated. The updated classification system provides more
   information on the share of avoidable food waste and waste materials
   suitable for recycling in mixed MSW. The updated method and the
   information gained from the composition studies are important in
   ensuring that the method will be adopted by municipal waste management
   companies and thus used widely in Finland. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{There is a general phenomenon of incoordination between garbage

   order to solve this problem, this paper introduced the
   subject-object-process model into the waste classification management
   system, and constructed a mandatory classification management model of
   municipal solid waste and a comprehensive evaluation index system.
   Taking Beijing, China, as an example, the coupling coordination degree
   of garbage classification behaviors of residents in different was
   compared, and the coordination status of household waste management and
   behaviors was obtained. The results show that the synergy between
   government management and residents' household waste classification
   behavior is between 0.40 and 0.68, and the synergy between enterprises'
   participation in governance and residents' behavior is between 0.45 and
   0.75. The coordination degree between domestic waste management and
   residents' participation behavior is generally in primary coordination
   or slight imbalance. The synergy degree between the secondary indicators
   of domestic waste management and residents' behavior is higher than that
   of the tertiary indicators. Superposition effect of integrated
   management measures is better; among the psychological factors affecting
   residents' classification behavior, the awareness rate and recognition
   degree of waste classification are very high, the awareness of
   environmental responsibility and social pressure are lagging behind. The
   study of synergy under the framework of subject-object-process not only
   quantifies the overall synergy between management and residents'
   behavior, but also provides a method to further implement garbage
   classification management in a targeted manner. Based on the synergy

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{298}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{In Shanghai, the biggest metropolis in China, the source classification
   of domestic waste began in the 1990s but achieved little success over
   the past thirty years. Surprisingly, the compulsory classification
   provision of Shanghai residents' domestic waste since 2019 has been
   successful. In this work, the overall status, and challenges of
   municipal solid waste (MSW) management in Shanghai under compulsory
   waste sorting rules are investigated. We tracked the classification
   efficiency of municipal solid waste, physicochemical characteristics of
   separated waste, and the carbon emissions arising from waste disposal
   system. It was found that almost 83.62 \% of household food waste has
   been effectively separated with high purity of 99.50 \%, while the lower
   heating value (LHV) of residual waste was increased by 96.4 \% compared
   to previous years. With effective waste classification, the net carbon
   emission of separated processing was reduced to 0.11 ton CE/ton waste.
   However, this system generated some negative outcomes as well such as
   the lower recovery value of metal in bottom ash and the higher chloride
   content in fly ash. Moreover, we have documented and discussed several
   challenges of sustainable waste management system in Shanghai in the
   text. In order to overcome those challenges, we recommend to: (i)
   establish a finer source separation and recycling system; (ii) develop
   highly-efficient resource recovery technologies of byproducts from waste
   disposal system; and (iii) propose optimization adjustment strategy for
   overcapacity in incineration facilities.}},

   spectroscopy is suitable for polymer detection, and it is a rapid,

   plastics, which are polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), acrylonitrile
   butadiene styrene (ABS), and acrylonitrile butadiene
   styrene/polycarbonate (ABS/PC) blend, was collected. The flame-retardant
   ABS showed difference from ABS in NIR spectra. Three classification
   methods, which are spectral angle mapper (SAM), partial least squares
   discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and linear discriminant analysis combined
   with principal component analysis (PCA-LDA), was tested. And the
   classification models trained on the virgin plastics have been compared
   with the models trained on the WEEE plastic to evaluate how these

   widely used classification method in spectral data analysis, but it had
   unsuccessful prediction when the training set only included virgin
   plastics. But the overall prediction accuracy over 99\% could be
   achieved by the other two whether the training set was the spectra of

Abstract = {{This article presents a mini review of research aimed at understanding
   material recovery from municipal solid waste. It focuses on two areas,
   waste sorting behaviour and collection systems, so that research on the
   link between these areas could be identified and evaluated. The main
   results presented and the methods used in the articles are categorised
   and appraised. The mini review reveals that most of the work that
   offered design guidelines for waste management systems was based on
   optimising technical aspects only. In contrast, most of the work that
   focused on user involvement did not consider developing the technical
   aspects of the system, but was limited to studies of user behaviour. The
   only clear consensus among the articles that link user involvement with
   the technical system is that convenient waste collection infrastructure
   is crucial for supporting source separation. This mini review reveals
   that even though the connection between sorting behaviour and technical
   infrastructure has been explored and described in some articles, there
   is still a gap when using this knowledge to design waste sorting
   systems. Future research in this field would benefit from being

Title = {Source separation, transportation, pretreatment, and valorization of
   municipal solid waste: a critical review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Abstract = {{Waste sorting is an effective means of enhancing resource or energy
   recovery from municipal solid waste (MSW). Waste sorting management
   system is not limited to source separation, but also involves at least
   three stages, i.e., collection and transportation (C\&T), pretreatment,
   and resource utilization. This review focuses on the whole process of
   MSW management strategy based on the waste sorting perspective. Firstly,
   as the sources of MSW play an essential role in the means of subsequent
   valorization, the factors affecting the generation of MSW and its
   prediction methods are introduced. Secondly, a detailed comparison of
   approaches to source separation across countries is presented.
   Constructing a top-down management system and incentivizing or
   constraining residents' sorting behavior from the bottom up is believed
   to be a practical approach to promote source separation. Then, the
   current state of C\&T techniques and its network optimization are
   reviewed, facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet
   of Things technologies. Furthermore, the advances in pretreatment
   strategies for enhanced sorting and resource recovery are introduced
   briefly. Finally, appropriate methods to valorize different MSW are
   proposed. It is worth noting that new technologies, such as AI, show
   high application potential in waste management. The sharing of
   (intermediate) products or energy of varying processing units will
   inject vitality into the waste management network and achieve
   sustainable development.

Abstract = {{Pollution from discarded plastic has become a serious environmental
   problem. The Great Pacific garbage patch consisting of abandoned
   plastics is killing marine life. In addition, micro-plastics decomposed
   by solar UV radiation and waves can accumulate in the human body.
   Recycling plastic is accordingly a critical element of waste management.
   As part of the solution to this problem, factory automation in recycling
   plants to handle more waste faster is essential. The amount of
   reproduced raw plastics is proportional to the inlet speed of the
   plastics waste stream into a recycling process line. Furthermore, the
   quality of recycled products with reproduced raw plastics depends on the
   sorting purity through the line. Thus, an automated system should be
   capable of real-time classification of the plastics category and rapid
   manipulation for removing selected plastics. We propose a real-time
   sorting system for mixed color plastics by applying a machine learning
   algorithm and a parallel manipulator with a vacuum suction pad. The
   learning data and picking test samples were collected from a municipal
   waste disposal site at RM corporation factory. This work shows the
   feasibility of real-time plastics recycling automation and a future

Abstract = {{Municipal solid waste (MSW) management remains a challenge in developing
   countries due to increasing waste generation, high costs associated with
   waste management and the structure of the containment systems

   systems by using documented cases reported mainly in publications in
   waste management in relation to non-engineered landfilling
   systems/approved dumpsites in Sub Saharan African (SSA) countries from
   2000 to 2018. The work identifies an existing system for the
   classification of landfill sites and utilises this system to determine
   the situation of landfill sites in SSA countries. Each article was
   categorised according to the main landfilling management practice
   reported: Uncontrolled dumping, semi controlled facility, medium
   controlled facility, medium/high-engineered facility or high state-of
   the-art facility. Findings suggested that 80\% of the documented cases
   of landfill sites assessed in SSA countries were classified as level 0
   or 1. The structure of the containment and controlled regime were
   identified by the focus group discussion participants as important
   predictors of possible strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats
   for the landfill sites considered. The study represents the first
   identifiable and comprehensive academic evaluation of landfill site
   classification based on site operations reported in the available peer
   reviewed literature. The information provides insight on the status of
   landfill sites in SSA countries with respect to the landfilling
   management practice and a baseline for alternative corrective measures.

Abstract = {{Kerbside collection of recyclable municipal waste represents an

   bring-in schemes, kerbside collection should provide higher convenience

   non-existent. In this paper we examine the effect of a kerbside
   collection on the amount of collected separated waste fractions, namely
   paper and cardboard and plastics, compared to the dominant collection
   through drop-off sites. We use data from 503 municipalities in Czechia.
   Our results suggest that kerbside collection can more than double the
   collected amount of paper and cardboard. In case of plastics we have
   also identified an increase in the separated amount, although the
   improvement was less notable. Additionally we have identified a strong
   effect of implementing incentive programs to the waste separation system
   in case of both examined waste fractions. On the other hand, the effect
   on municipal finance was not very significant, and waste expenditures
   are approximately the same with both collection systems.}},

Abstract = {{Innovative and efficient use of municipal solid waste as a source of
   energy is an important way to promote the transition to low-carbon
   cities. One key strategy to improve energy efficiency is to create a
   network of multiple sectors that can produce and utilize energy from
   waste. This mechanism has already been adopted at the urban scale in
   several developed countries as a way to enhance environmental efficiency
   and reduce adverse impacts. However, to use waste efficiently, it is
   necessary to examine the supply chain of wastes as a source of materials
   with potential to generate energy. Such an examination can inform the
   design of an efficient waste-to-energy process that will create a
   symbiosis between industry and the waste management sector. In this
   paper, we describe a model that evaluates energy recovery efficiency by
   considering the costs and benefits of an innovative waste-to-energy
   system. In the model, we also consider the material and energy flow of
   wastes in accordance with the quantity and quality of waste emissions,
   the separation system, treatment technologies and combinations thereof,
   and energy recovery and use in other sectors. The scenario was designed
   by identifying waste management options, including waste
   quantity/quality; the separation system; the treatment technology model
   for wet or dry methane fermentation; incineration; a combined system
   that involves superheating with exchanging heat between the incineration
   plant and fermenter; and use of refuse paper and plastic fuel (RPF). The
   results revealed that energy recovery efficiency was most dependent on
   the effective use of RPF with a relatively high lower heating value and
   superheating of boiler steam by methane gas in the combined system. An
   important conclusion was that the most efficient system was a combined
   system in which paper, plastic, and RPF were separated from 80\% of the
   waste, and 20\% of the waste was incinerated and used for wet methane
   fermentation. The amounts of energy recovered from that system was 54.5
   kWh/t, and the efficiency was 33.4\%. Analytical results indicated that
   it is possible to create the critical technology and to develop policy
   insights needed to make efficient waste management systems for the
   transition to low-carbon cities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Confronted with a series of problems caused by surging generation of
   municipal solid waste (MSW), the Chinese central and local governments
   have promulgated and implemented policies to deal with them, including
   promotions of the classification of MSW. However, to date, practical
   knowledge and understanding about benefits for garbage classification
   from its environmental performance perspective is still limited. The
   present study is purposed to comprehensively investigate the
   environmental effects of garbage classification on municipal solid waste
   management (MSWM) systems based on three proposed garbage classification
   scenarios in China, via a comparative life cycle impact assessment
   (LCIA). Taking advantage of Impact Assessment of Chemical Toxics
   (IMPACT) 2002+ method, this comparative LCIA study can quantitatively
   evaluate midpoint, endpoint, and single scored life cycle impacts for
   the studied MSWM systems. A Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis is carried
   out to test the effectiveness and reliabilities of the LCIA results. The
   LCIA and uncertainty analysis results show that MSWM systems based on
   various garbage classification scenarios have significant variations in
   the studied midpoint, endpoint, and single scored environmental impacts.
   Different garbage classification scenarios have their individual
   environmental-friendly superiority for specific impact categories.
   Overall, results of this study demonstrate that MSW treatment systems
   integrated with garbage classification are more environmentally friendly
   by comparison with non-classification; and that the more elaborate the
   level of MSW classification, the smaller its impacts on the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Policymakers apply various policy instruments to meet the objective of
   resource conservation in the framework of waste policy. The cantonal
   waste policy of Geneva implements this objective by focussing on sorting
   of household waste for recycling. Cantonal and municipal authorities use
   incentive instruments and a mix of infrastructural and persuasive
   instruments to develop waste sorting for households. However, they have
   so far failed to reach the objective of a recovery rate of 50\% for
   household waste in Geneva. This study assesses recycling and sorting
   practices for household waste in Geneva as basis for the formulation of
   a new improved strategy. This interdisciplinary assessment combines a
   policy evaluation of the household waste management system over the
   period 2002-2013 with a situation analysis of the current household
   waste management practices through a SWOT analysis by using
   triangulation as the method of data collection. The results of policy
   evaluation show the effectiveness of incentive instruments (e.g.,
   incineration tax) in encouraging the Genevan municipalities to implement
   and improve sorting infrastructures and services. Moreover, they
   demonstrate that a combination of infrastructural (e.g., collection
   points) and persuasive (e.g., awareness raising campaigns) instruments
   is effective for enhancing the Genevan household waste sorting practices
   under certain conditions. The situation analysis identifies the
   significant internal and external factors that have a positive or a
   negative influence on household waste sorting and recycling in Geneva.
   The outputs of the policy evaluation and situation analysis serve to
   formulate a strategy that is adapted to local specificities. This
   strategy highlights the necessity for policymakers to avoid unnecessary
   duplication of the sorting system among the stakeholders and the
   importance of national authorities for creating framework conditions to
   encourage the implementation of recycling sectors. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{707}},
Month = {{MAR 10}},
Abstract = {{The implementation of domestic waste classification following the
   principles of reduction, recycling, and harmlessness is an effective
   method to improve the urban and rural environments and to promote
   resource recycling. However, in many developing countries, the community
   residents lack awareness of the benefits of classified collection, which
   leads to a lack of initiative to classify MSW. To make the people
   realize the importance of MSW classification and increase the
   classification dynamics, Suzhou, China was taken as an example in this
   study, and residential areas were selected as sampling sites for
   classified and mixed collection of domestic waste. The main components
   of the odorous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from the
   dustbins via different disposal modes were determined by sampling in
   spring, summer, autumn, and winter. In addition, the ozone formation
   potential (OFP) and human health risk assessment of the VOCs were
   analyzed. Halogenated compounds were the major pollutants from the
   household waste dustbins of the residential areas. However, aromatic
   compounds contributed the most to the OFP of the VOCs. The OFP of VOCs
   reached the highest peak in summer, which was 1.02 x 10(3) mu g/m(3).
   Furthermore, more attention needs to be paid in classifying waste to
   reduce the concentration of OFP. Although there was a carcinogenic risk
   in spring and summer, it declined after waste classification. Compared
   with mixed collection, the source-classified collection of garbage had
   advantages in terms of controlling the emission of VOCs, ozone formation
   potential, and human health risk. These results could provide the
   evidence demonstrating the advantages of waste classification and
   attract people's attention. Furthermore, the results can also provide
   impetus to those countries, where separate collection of waste has not
   yet been implemented, to improve the enthusiasm for classification and
   the integrity of waste classification system. Residents should be
   encouraged to classify household waste in residential areas. (C) 2018

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This study was based on the premise that Technosols constructed under
   tropical conditions are a valuable tool for inexpensive mine reclamation
   programs. These anthropogenic soils are still poorly studied in Brazil
   and are not recognized by the Brazilian Soil Classification System.
   Given the importance of mining to the Brazilian economy (the sector
   accounts for 20\% of all products exported and 5\% of the gross domestic
   product), there is an urgency to properly manage the large amount of
   waste produced. For this purpose, we suggest the use of Technosols as a
   strategy to overcome both land degradation and waste production by
   presenting a successful case of mine rehabilitation combining limestone
   wastes and tropical grasses. We show that Technosols constructed from

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{973-990}},
Abstract = {{Municipal solid waste (MSW) contains mineral materials which are seldom
   considered as a potential resource. Currently, the waste management
   sector pays attention to recyclable parts, biodegradable material,
   waste-to-energy fraction, and residues after waste reuse and recycle. In
   contrast, this study focus as on the mineral matter in MSW. The aim was
   to analyze and discuss the sources of mineral matter in MSW, the impact
   which the minerals have on waste management technologies, and finally,
   the possibility to recycle the mineral matter. The contribution of
   inorganic matter in the MSW stream is significant (about 20 wt.\%). In
   the years 2012-2015, the average content of mineral matter in mixed MSW
   in Poland ranged from 16 wt.\% to 36 wt.\%, and the content of organic
   in MSW ranged from 20 wt.\% to 42 wt.\%. Minerals in MSW have rather
   negative impact on waste management technologies and their final
   products, and can be sorted out from the MSW stream, either in the
   households or in a central sorting line. However, in central collection
   and separation systems it is difficult to obtain a mineral matter
   fraction in subsequent processing steps due to technological limitations
   (inefficiency of devices), high degree of waste fragmentation and
   pollution of mineral matter with other waste. This indicates a hampered
   ability to separate minerals in a form available for reuse, so an
   effective system should be based on improved segregation at the source.}},

Abstract = {{The urban household solid waste (HSW) classification and recycling
   system is a complex adaptive system (CAS), containing multiple agents
   and the behaviors between them are interactive. In order to figure out
   which is the most effective waste management policy for the HSW
   classification and recycling, this study tried to establish a simulation
   model combining multi-agent based simulation (MABS) techniques with a
   social survey questionnaire. The model can simulate the behavior change
   of the agents in the system under different policy scenarios. Then the
   proposed model is utilized in Suzhou city in eastern China. The system
   contains three main agents: (1) the resident agents that generate the
   HSW, (2) the recycling site and scavenger agents that collect the
   recyclable materials (paper, metal, plastics and etc.) in the household
   garbage. (3) the agents in the sanitation department (incineration power
   plants and landfills) that is responsible for the municipal solid waste
   collection and terminal garbage disposal. In addition, three waste
   charge policy scenarios are set and relevant simulation experiments are
   carried out. The results show that the specific charge policy can
   improve the performance of residents' separation behavior, which is a
   more effective way to reduce the HSW and increase the collection rate of
   domestic recyclable resources (DRR). And there exists certain benefit
   conflicts between the environmental sanitation agent and the DRR
   recycling agent at the present stage in Suzhou city. To resolve the
   issue of the urban HSW management in China, it is necessary to balance
   the profit of charge point of agents in the system. In addition, it
   needs to combine the municipal garbage collection network and the
   renewable resource recycling network together. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Nowadays, dealing with organic waste (or biowaste) remains a global

   50 percent organicwaste. In the European Union (EU) with a share of
   34\%, biowaste is a dominantfraction of the municipal waste (EEA, 2020).
   Therefore, separate collection at source and environmentally sound
   treatment of biowaste are of key importance. An intensive optimisation
   of biowaste separate collection is needed to balance demands of
   municipal representatives and households' needs. Based on the
   mixed-method approach we developed a MCDA model complemented by
   expert-based weighting assessment and combined with the GIS localisation
   tools aimed at the optimisation of biowaste container locations that
   reflects various spatial conditions, preconditions for the localisation
   of containers and its cost intensity. We concluded that changing the
   density of containers, distance between the address point and container,
   and selecting container locations that respect the habits of households
   and demands of the collection technology significantly affect the total
   and collection costs. We confirmed that the decreases in the total costs
   were not significant for maximum walking distances of over 95 m, and
   would approach zero for distances of over 230 m. When the maximum
   walking distance exceeds 268 m, 40\% of all inhabitants would not
   participate in the system as it would be inconvenient for them. A
   recycling campaign is needed to increase their willingness to
   participate in the system. We provided arguments for decision-makers how
   to balance convenience of the biowaste separation system and collection

Abstract = {{Wadi Feiran basin is one of the most promising areas in southern Sinai
   (Egypt) for establishing new communities and for growth in agriculture,

   mitigated by efficient use of runoff and rainwater through appropriate
   management, thereby promoting sustainable development. Strategies
   include the mitigation of runoff hazards and promoting the natural and
   artificial recharge of aquifers. This study uses a watershed modeling
   system, geographic information system, and classification scheme to
   predict the effects of various mitigation options on the basin's water
   resources. Rainwater-harvesting techniques could save more than 77\% of
   the basin's runoff (by volume), which could be used for storage and
   aquifer recharge. A guide map is provided that shows possible locations
   for the proposed mitigation options in the study basin. Appropriate
   measures should be undertaken urgently: mitigation of groundwater
   contamination (including effective sewage effluent management); regular
   monitoring of the municipal, industrial and agricultural processes that
   release contaminants; rationalization and regulation of the application
   of agro-chemicals to farmland; and regular monitoring of contaminants in

Abstract = {{The rising awareness of decreasing natural resources has brought forward
   the idea of a circular economy and resource efficiency in Europe. As a
   part of this movement, European countries have identified the need to
   monitor residual waste flows in order to make recycling more efficient.
   In Finland, studies on the composition of residual household waste have
   mostly been conducted using different methods, which makes the
   comparison of the results difficult. The aim of this study was to
   develop a reliable method for residual household waste composition
   studies. First, a literature review on European study methods was
   performed. Also, 19 Finnish waste composition studies were compared in
   order to identify the shortcomings of the current Finnish residual
   household waste composition data. Moreover, the information needs of
   different waste management authorities concerning residual household
   waste were studied through a survey and personal interviews.
   Stratification, sampling, the classification of fractions and
   statistical analysis were identified as the key factors in a residual
   household waste composition study. The area studied should be divided
   into non-overlapping strata in order to decrease the heterogeneity of
   waste and enable comparisons between different waste producers. A
   minimum of six subsamples, each 100 kg, from each stratum should be
   sorted. Confidence intervals for each waste category should be
   determined in order to evaluate the applicability of the results. A new
   three-level classification system was created based on Finnish
   stakeholders' information needs and compared to four other European
   waste composition study classifications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Pages = {{179373-179388}},
Abstract = {{With the increasing pace of industrialization and economic growth, the
   continuous increase in household waste has become a great concern all
   over the world. Residents' participation in household waste sorting is
   an effective way to promote the recycling of household waste. How to
   effectively promote more residents to participate in waste sorting has
   become an important issue of the government. Previous research mainly
   used two methods in exploring residents' intention to sort waste:
   qualitative case studies to explore potential causal descriptions and
   statistic studies with the structural equation modeling. These
   researches, however, consider one special case or the net effect of a
   single factor, which fails to present the comparisons across
   international contexts and hardly clarifies the complex pathways to
   residents' participation. In this research, a novel method fsQCA
   (fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis) is applied to explore the
   pathways both from a macro-level perspective and in different national
   contexts. Results suggest four different pathways influence residents'
   participation in waste sorting. In the four pathways, GDP level and
   source separation system are key causal conditions to influence
   residents to sort waste, but different configurations of these
   conditions influence whether residents participate in waste sorting at a
   high rate. Only when the external conditions and the socio-demographic
   conditions are combined in a specific form, residents participate in
   waste sorting at a high rate. At last, the findings provide some
   exercisable suggestions for decision makers in developing countries to
   design promotion programs and waste sorting policies.}},

Abstract = {{Recently Xiamen (China) has encountered various challenges of municipal
   solid waste management (MSWM) such as lack of a complete garbage sorting
   and recycling system, the absence of waste segregation between organic
   and dry waste at source, and a shortage of complete and clear
   information about the MSW generated. This article critically analyzes
   the existing bottlenecks in its waste management system and discusses
   the way forward for the city to enhance its MSWM by drawing lessons from
   Hong Kong's effectiveness in dealing with the same problems over the
   past decades. Solutions to the MSWM problem are not only limited to
   technological options, but also integrate environmental, legal, and
   institutional perspectives. The solutions include (1) enhancing source
   separation and improving recycling system; (2) improving the legislation
   system of the MSWM; (3) improvement of terminal disposal facilities in
   the city; (4) incorporating digitization into MSWM; and (5) establishing
   standards and definitions for recycled products and/or recyclable
   materials. We also evaluate and compare different aspects of MSWM in
   Xiamen and Hong Kong SAR (special administrative region) under the
   framework of `One Country, Two Systems' concerning environmental
   policies, generation, composition, characteristics, treatment, and
   disposal of their MSW. The nexus of society, economics of the MSW, and
   the environment in the sustainability sphere are established by
   promoting local recycling industries and the standardization of recycled
   products and/or recyclable materials. The roles of digitization
   technologies in the 4th Industrial Revolution for waste reduction in the
   framework of circular economy (CE) are also elaborated. This
   technological solution may improve the city's MSWM in terms of public
   participation in MSW separation through reduction, recycle, reuse,
   recovery, and repair (5Rs) schemes. To meet top-down policy goals such
   as a 35\% recycling rate for the generated waste by 2030, incorporating
   digitization into the MSWM provides the city with technology-driven
   waste solutions. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Design/methodology/approach Following a short introduction, this first
   considers robotic waste sorting systems and then describes two systems

   some recent research activities. Finally, brief conclusions are drawn.
   Findings Robotic systems exploiting artificial intelligence combined
   with various sensing and machine vision technologies are playing a
   growing role in the sorting of municipal and industrial waste, prior to
   recycling. These are mostly based on delta robots and can achieve pick
   rates of 60-70 items/min and be configured to recognise and select a
   wide range of different materials and items from moving conveyors.
   Electronic waste recycling is yet to benefit significantly from robotics
   although a limited number of systems have been developed for product
   disassembly. Disassembly techniques are the topic of a concerted
   research effort which often involves robots and humans collaborating and
   sharing disassembly tasks.
   Originality/value This provides an insight into the present-day uses and
   potential future role of robots in recycling which has traditionally

   cycles of shrinkage and swelling was measured by the falling and
   constant head laboratory permeameter. The sand box and pressure chambers
   with ceramic plates were used to determine the water retention curve
   parameters in the range of 0-15 bar. The obtained results showed the

Abstract = {{The cone penetration test (CPT) was evaluated as a tool for
   characterizing landfilled municipal solid waste (MSW). Cone penetration
   test soundings were performed at 16 locations in a closed MSW landfill
   in Florida, United States, where tip resistance (qt), sleeve friction
   resistance (fs), and friction ratio (fr) data were collected up to a
   depth of 10m, and compared to waste properties from borings in the same
   location as five of the CPTs. The delineation of cover soil, waste, and
   subgrade soil was readily identifiable from the CPT data, but
   intermediate cover layers could not be discerned. At greater depths in
   the landfill, waste generally exhibited greater degradation with an
   average biochemical methane potential of 0.044LCH4/g volatile solids
   versus shallower waste that was less degraded with an average BMP of
   0.200LCH4/g volatile solids. More degraded waste tended to have lower
   tip resistances of 3.6-3.7MPa than less degraded waste that exhibited
   5.0-5.4MPa. The friction ratio tended to be greater for more degraded
   waste (2.8-3.2\%) than less degraded waste (2.3-2.4\%). The CPT data
   collected from the MSW landfill were also compared to conventional
   correlations to soil classification systems. The CPT data for more
   degraded waste generally correlated with finer soil classifications
   while CPT readings of less degraded waste corresponded to more coarse
   soils. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Assuming a duopoly market where the producers use packaging
   recyclability to vertically differentiated their product, we analyse the
   efficiency of an extended producer responsibility (EPR) to deliver
   optimal choices of packaging. In this paper, the EPR means that the
   producers bear the social disposal cost of packaging waste resulting
   from households' consumption of their product. Disposal of household
   packaging waste comprises sorting and treatment operations. Therefore,
   the social disposal cost is the sum of both the sorting and the dumping
   costs. We confirm that an EPR is not an optimal policy, and then we show
   that an optimal policy couples an EPR to two bonus/penalty systems: the
   first one reduces the sorting cost borne by the producers, the second
   one affects the dumping cost borne by the producers. This optimal policy
   entails that the producers bear a disposal cost higher (respectively
   lower) than the social disposal cost when improving packaging
   recyclability is cost-reducing (respectively costly).}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the output of municipal solid waste (MSW) in China has
   been increased by 10\% annually, and the traditional disposal methods,
   such as sanitary landfill, incineration and compost, will produce
   secondary pollution. In order to deal with the current predicament which
   presents a large number of MSW discharged, and cities are besieged by
   garbage, so promoting MSW sorting reclaim is very important, it can
   transform ``waste{''} into new resource. China has launched some pilot
   projects to sort and reclaim MSW in some cities since 2000, but with
   little success. Firstly, the existing problems in the disposal of MSW
   have been summarized, then the management system of MSW sorting reclaim
   has been constructed according to the experience of foreign countries.
   At the same time, the concept of ``Cradle to Cradle{''} which compose of
   MSW delivery (waste classification, design of garbage bag, collection
   time and design of garbage can), and utilization of MSW (different loops
   are designed for different wastes). Finally, the countermeasures and
   suggestions of promoting MSW sorting reclaim are proposed. The results
   have significant value for constructing ``resource-conserving \&
   environmental-friendly{''} society and guiding MSW sorting reclaim in
   China. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Remote sensing of the Earth allows to receive information of medium, a
   high spatial resolution from space vehicles and to conduct hyperspectral
   measurements. In many cases, waste disposal sites (WDS) is not legal.
   So, it is very important to use the system for automatic detection such
   places using satellite images. In this paper, a model of the automated
   space monitoring system for the presence of waste disposal sites is
   developed. The proposed system includes the following blocks: a database
   of WDS; a subsystem for detecting unauthorized WDS; a subsystem for
   monitoring the design, operation and reclamation rules for existing WDS;
   a subsystem for estimating the parameters of the WDS and their impact on
   the environment; a subsystem of satellite monitoring. We propose a
   method of detecting high-rise buildings landfills, such as municipal
   dumps and solid waste, according to a radar image (the height of the
   ground level). For system design, we use the apparatus of discrete
   orthogonal transformations. The impact of the WDS influence on
   agricultural crops is analyzed, based on the data of the Earth remote
   space sensing based on the orthogonal transform. The purpose of the work
   is the modeling of an automated space monitoring system for the presence
   of waste disposal facilities using regularization method in the problem
   of filtering of space images from the noise stored in the archives. As a
   result, the proposed method demonstrates good accuracy in detection the
   solid waste disposal site on real satellite images.}},

Abstract = {{During the last two decades, EU legislation has put increasing pressure
   on member countries to achieve specified recycling targets for municipal
   household waste. These targets can be obtained in various ways choosing
   collection methods, separation methods, decentral or central logistic
   systems, etc. This paper compares municipal solid waste (MSW) management
   practices in various EU countries to identify the characteristics and
   key issues from a waste management and reverse logistics point of view.
   Further, we investigate literature on modelling municipal solid waste
   logistics in general. Comparing issues addressed in literature with the
   identified issues in practice result in a research agenda for modelling
   municipal solid waste logistics in Europe. We conclude that waste
   recycling is a multi -disciplinary problem that needs to be considered
   at different decision levels simultaneously. A holistic view and taking
   into account the characteristics of different waste types are necessary
   when modelling a reverse supply chain for MSW recycling. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Municipal solid waste is a significant problem, particularly in
   developing countries that lack sufficient infrastructure and useable
   land mass to process it in an appropriate manner. Some developing
   nations are experiencing a combination of issues that prevent proper
   management of solid waste. This paper reviews the management of
   municipal solid waste in northeast Thailand, using the Tha Khon Yang
   Sub-district Municipality (TKYSM) in Maha Sarakham Province as a case
   study. The combination of rapid population and economic growth and its
   associated affluence has led to an increase in the use of consumer items
   and a concomitant increase in the production of municipal solid waste.
   In the TKYSM there is pressure on local government to establish a
   suitable waste management program to resolve the escalating waste
   crisis. The aim of this study is to provide viable solutions to waste
   management challenges in the TKYSM, and potentially to offer guidance to
   other similar localities also facing the same challenges. It is well
   established that successful changes to waste management require an
   understanding of local context and consideration of specific issues
   within a region. Therefore, extensive community consultation and
   engagement with local experts was undertaken to develop an understanding
   of the particular waste management challenges of the TKYSM. Research
   methods included observations, one-on-one interviews and focus groups
   with a range of different stakeholders. The outcomes of this research
   highlight a number of opportunities to improve local infrastructure and
   operational capacity around solid waste management. Waste management in
   rural and urban areas needs to be approached differently. Solutions
   include: development of appropriate policy and implementation plans
   (based around the recommendations of this paper); reduction of the
   volume of waste going to landfill by establishing a waste separation
   system; initiation of a collection service that supports waste
   separation at source; educating the citizens of the municipality; and
   the local government staff, and for the local government to seek
   external support from the local temples and expertise from the nearby
   university.}},

   sequence plan is a key challenge considering that it cannot be solved by
   an exhaustive search due to the combinatorial explosion of the search
   space. This paper reports an approach for generating optimal PAP
   sequence plan for robotic sorting of recyclables from source-segregated
   MSW stream in a system equipped with thermal-imaging technique. The PAP
   sequence generation is formulated as an optimization problem wherein the
   objective is to minimize the total sorting time. The formulated problem
   has been solved using a genetic algorithm (GA)-based approach. Numerical
   simulations as well as physical experiments using a 6 degrees-of-freedom
   (DOF) articulated manipulator have been performed to test and validate
   the developed optimal sequence generation algorithm. Results revealed an
   improvement of up to 4.28\% speedup in total sorting time over that of
   randomly generated sequences. It is envisaged that the developed
   approach can substantially improve the sorting performance in an MRF.}},

Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{61-72}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Bottom ash from municipal solid waste incineration is usually treated in
   order to recover valuable materials like metals and to generate a
   mineral material for utilisation in construction industry or disposal.
   At present, different technologies and combinations thereof are used for
   bottom ash treatment resulting in different quantities and qualities of
   the final products (metals and minerals). So far, a comparison of these
   technologies is hardly possible based on the available literature.
   Hence, the present paper presents and applies a modelling approach that
   allows predicting the quantities and qualities (in terms of composition)
   of the final outputs of bottom ash treatment plants. In particular,
   material flow analysis models of five different bottom ash treatment
   plants were established on goods, material and element level and the
   mass and composition of the output flows of these plants were calculated
   based on an input of 118,000 Mg/a of bottom ash dry matter. The highest
   recovery of metals (up to 8640 +/- 820 Mg/a iron, 1530 +/- 220 Mg/a
   aluminium, 627 +/- 73 Mg/a stainless steel and 608 +/- 70 Mg/a heavy
   non-ferrous metals) can be achieved in plants that apply comminution
   before any ageing processes and are equipped with jiggers, inductive
   sorting systems and/or a high number of eddy current separators. The
   iron scrap fractions separated from bottom ash are contaminated by up to
   114 +/- 44 mg/kg Cd and up to 9900 +/- 3300 mg/kg Cu, which might impair
   their suitability for recycling. Only minor differences in the
   composition of mineral material generated by different treatment plants
   could be observed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Metal recycling is an issue that needs attention and should be practiced
   by people as it has many advantages to human and Earth. In order to get
   a metal from Earth, the process called mining are needed where it can
   harm our natural resources due to depletion of the area to be mined. If
   the process is not controlled, most of the areas on Earth will have huge
   excavation holes. So, people should be responsible to prevent this from
   happening to preserve the environment in a good quality by recycling the
   metal material. By metal recycling, it can save an energy and resources
   as it can reduce the demand for raw materials, hence maintain the
   natural resources for the future. The proposed automatic metal waste
   separation system is intended to ease the people to separate the waste
   material. Besides, it will make the metal recycling industry work easier
   because the metal waste is already isolated at garbage collection side.
   The purpose of the project is to design a system to separate the metal
   recyclable household waste automatically and record the data waste
   collected. There are total of four detectors used to separate the
   non-metal, steel, copper and aluminum metal waste. The average time used
   to complete metal separation process by using the proposed prototype is
   14.5 seconds. This project includes a mechanical part, programming part
   and an electronic design. The system will be programmed using Arduino
   Mega as a microcontroller to control all the electronic component in the
   system.}},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},

Volume = {{295}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{To ensure the transparency and comparability of life cycle assessment
   (LCA) studies of waste manage-ment systems, a comprehensive waste data
   is necessary. We sampled and characterised municipal household waste in
   Denmark to investigate the impact of recycling schemes on the
   composition and generation of residual household waste (RHW), provide
   detailed waste data to waste management au-thorities as well as LCA
   practitioners. In total, 20 ton of waste, taken from 1,800 households in
   seven Danish municipalities in 2011 and 2017, was manually sorted. These
   municipalities had in common the systems for source separation of paper,
   cardboard, metal and glass, whereas the recycling of food and plastic
   varied among them. The waste sorting campaigns provided detailed
   composition of individual recycling scheme including (1) food, (2)
   plastic, (3) paper, (4) cardboard, (5) metal, and (6) glass as well as
   (7) RHW. For each of the six recycling schemes, waste was sorted into
   two different waste catalogues containing 48 and 50 fractions. Such a
   detailed waste composition enables waste management au-thorities to
   design comprehensive guidelines for waste sorting, while providing LCA
   practitioners with data that can significantly improve the validity and
   certainty of their results and recommendations. The results show that
   the highest misplacement rate was found in waste bins dedicated to food,
   plastic and RHW. The statistical analyses show that source separation of
   food and plastic waste reduces significantly (11\%) the total amount of
   household waste, suggesting that, in addition to the environmental
   benefit of diverting food and plastic waste from landfill and
   incineration, source segregation may as well contribute to waste
   prevention. Moreover, the source-sorting of food waste, independently of
   whether plastics were sorted or not, significantly influences the
   composition of the RHW.

Abstract = {{To achieving the European Union's environmental policy objectives for
   waste management region of Liepaja, it is necessary to develop a waste
   management model that is relevant to an existing regional system, taking
   into account the amount of produced waste, the processing technology and
   infrastructure, public behavior and regulatory framework, and at the
   same time it allows to operate the system in a sustainable way.
   The suitable place for main waste treatment infrastructure deployment in
   the Liepaja region is a landfill ``Kivites{''} because it has already
   set up the infrastructure for waste mechanical sorting, landfill gas
   collection and using in combined heat and power, as well as waste
   disposal.
   The novelty of this study gets mechanical biological processing
   technologies in using for mixed municipal waste without full mechanical
   treatment. Such an approach is chosen based on studies of relatively
   high biological material admixture in recyclable material.
   The study has been developed the management approach not only for
   processing technology but also provides a theoretical model of municipal
   solid waste mechanical biological treatment for region Liepaja. The
   model includes the benefits of the system, the preconditions of
   implementation, as well as the solutions of short and long term
   implementation. In addition, the exisiting biodegradable waste
   management model of Liepaja Region that based on household waste
   disposal in the energy cells with biogas extraction - is not an
   effective solution and does not comply with European Union and Latvian
   environmental policy requirements regarding the biodegradable waste
   disposal and reduction of waste materials for recycling. In Latvia has
   not yet been implemented, no mechanical biological treatment technology
   with dry fermentation reactor, so there is no definition of a
   sustainable waste management system that would enable the effective
   separation, collection and treatment of organic waste, thus improving
   the rest of the waste materials for the quality and use of facilities.
   Methods of research is the analysis of documents, sociological research
   methods (deep and structured interviews methods, survey method), random
   method of case study and content analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Saudi Arabia) has started
   implementing the National Transformation Program (NTP) that aims to
   achieve government operational excellence, improve economic factors, and

Abstract = {{Waste mechanics focuses on the degradation characteristics and
   mechanical behaviors of municipal solid waste (MSW). Knowledge of waste
   mechanics helps solve the severe geoenvironmental challenges for MSW
   landfills. This paper first summarized and compared the physical
   components and chemical composition of MSWs from 20 countries, including
   developed and developing countries, and proposed a MSW classification
   system based on the food waste content and the ratio of cellulose to
   lignin. Secondly, the degradation characteristics between high food
   waste content (HFWC) and low food waste content (LFWC) MSWs, originated
   from their differences in chemical composition due to the distinctions
   in physical components of MSWs, were compared quantitatively by mass
   loss, leachate generation, landfill gas (LFG) generation, and
   contaminants in leachate. Thirdly, mechanical behaviors closely related
   to the degradation characteristics of both HFWC and LFWC MSWs, including
   permeability, compressibility, shear strength, and lateral pressure,
   were elaborated on. Fourthly, degrees of hydrolysis, methane generation,
   and consolidation, calculated by the stabilization-consolidation model,
   were introduced to characterize the stabilization process of HFWC MSW
   landfills, which provided a basis for sustainable landfilling for HFWC
   MSW landfills. The obtained features of HFWC MSW landfills, including
   the distributions of leachate mounds and LFG, settlement, and slope
   stability, showed the causes of main geo-challenges at HFWC MSW
   landfills, including high risks of leachate leakage and slope
   instability, and low LFG collection efficiency, were consistent with the
   monitoring results of several cases. Finally, technologies, practices,
   and designs towards sustainable landfilling for HFWC MSW landfills in
   China were presented, which could also serve as useful references and
   guidelines for other countries in similar situations.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon emission from municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment is one of the
   anthropogenic sources to cause climate change, which accounts for 3-5\%
   of global greenhouse gas emissions according to the report of the United
   Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). At the same time, the gases and
   liquid discharged from MSW treatment can also cause other environmental
   impacts, such as climate change, photochemical ozone synthesis, and
   acidification, especially in huge city with huge population as Beijing,
   China. This paper proposed an eco-efficiency analysis method, which
   aimed to yield maximum overall environmental improvement per unit
   investment cost during its life cycle processing. This method took the
   overall reduction in the environmental impact of MSW treatment using
   cost-effective techniques as the objective to optimize waste disposal
   systems. The separation ratio during MSW collection and the proportion
   of techniques used for treatment were the major indicators for
   optimization measures. For Beijing, an increase in the waste separation
   ratio during collection proved to be the most effective measure, with an
   eco-efficiency score of 0.144. Adjustment of the proportion of treatment
   techniques used was less eco-efficient, with an increase in the
   proportion of composting being the most effective approach. Based on
   real needs, the objective should be to reduce the proportion of
   landfills used and increase the amount of composting and incineration.
   This optimization measure had the lowest cost and an eco-efficiency
   score of 0.0461, which is 60\% higher than that for the measure with the
   lowest eco-efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   the significance of waste sorting and relevant environmental matters.
   The first step of the project was to execute a full waste audit in UAS
   to identify precise waste quantities which occurred on daily basis.
   During the week the environmental technology students weighed and sorted
   all the waste in all premises of the UAS. Based on the collected data,
   the new system comprised of 19 waste collection points with sorting
   instructions and adequate volume. The total number of garbage cans was
   reduced by 46\% and mixed household garbage cans by 72\%. The final step
   was to analyse the efficiency of the new waste collection arrangements.

Abstract = {{Minimization of the environmental impact of the incineration process and
   to produce energy efficiently are the most important considerations in
   obtaining efficient operation of waste-to-energy (WtE) plants. WtE
   operation can obtain significant improvements by predicting combustion
   properties of municipal solid waste (MSW) prior to incineration.
   Combustion properties of MSW can be assessed by estimating the weighted
   waste fractions such as paper and cardboard, plastic or inert and fines.
   Waste materials and fractions can be recognized using imaging techniques
   and image classification methods based on deep convolution neural
   networks (CNN). We have tested a new sensor system for image
   classification based on using multispectral (MS) images and deep CNN
   pretrained on the ImageNet database to recognize MSW categories. MS
   camera was used for sampling images above the walking floor of a WtE
   plant (StatKraft Varme Tiller, Trondheim). The waste load was
   automatically registered as industrial or household waste at the time of
   delivery. The MS images from 49 waste loads were used to perform
   transfer-learning on EfficientNetB0 model weighted with
   ImageNet-NoisyStudent parameters. Using the predefined classes, a test
   and training set were generated from the 49 waste loads delivered
   between June and September (2020). The training set consisted of 35
   waste loads while the remaining 14 waste loads were used as test. The
   weights for the image feature extraction was constant during training
   while the fully connected layer (top-layer) was updated for each epoch.
   The model performance on the test set was assessed by making predictions
   on the household or industrial waste images. With a fixed threshold
   value at 0.5, the model showed 85\% accuracy, 92\% precision, 89\%
   recall and 90\% F-measure for industrial class, while for household
   class the model showed 80\% accuracy, 94\% precision, 81\% recall and
   87\% F-measure. For all threshold values, the area under curve estimated
   from the receiver operating characteristic plot showed that the model
   has 87\% confidence in distinguishing household waste images from
   industrial waste images and 90\% confidence in distinguishing industrial
   waste images from household waste images.}},

   determine citizens' attitudes and inclination toward source separation.
   Survey result shows that the vast majority of respondents hold
   consciously positive attitudes toward participation in source
   separation. Moreover, the respondents ignore the operability of
   separation methods and would rather choose the complex separation method
   involving four or more subclassed categories. For the effects of
   separation methods, the site experiment result demonstrates that the
   relatively simple separation method involving two categories (food waste
   and other waste) achieves the best effect with the highest accuracy rate
   (83.1\%) and the lowest miscellany rate (16.9\%) among the proposed
   experimental alternatives. The outcome reflects the inconsistency
   between people's environmental awareness and behavior. Such
   inconsistency and conflict may be attributed to the lack of
   environmental knowledge. Environmental education is assumed to be a
   fundamental solution to improve the effect of source separation of MSW
   in Changsha. Important management tips on source separation, including
   the reformation of the current pay-as-you-throw (PAYT) system, are
   presented in this work.Implications: A case study on the source
   separation of municipal solid waste was performed in Changsha. An effect
   evaluation method based on accuracy rate and miscellany rate was
   proposed to study the performance of different separation methods. The
   site experiment result demonstrates that the two-category (food waste
   and other waste) method achieves the best effect. The inconsistency
   between people's inclination and the effect of source separation exists.
   The proposed method can be expanded to other cities to determine the
   most effective separation method during planning stages or to evaluate
   the performance of running source separation systems.}},

Abstract = {{The consumption of milk in China is increasing as living standards
   rapidly improve, and huge amounts of aseptic composite milk packaging
   waste are being generated. Aseptic composite packaging is composed of
   paper, polyethylene, and aluminum. It is difficult to separate the
   polyethylene and aluminum, so most of the waste is currently sent to
   landfill or incinerated with other municipal solid waste, meaning that
   enormous amounts of resources are wasted. A wet process technique for
   separating the aluminum and polyethylene from the composite materials
   after the paper had been removed from the original packaging waste was
   studied. The separation efficiency achieved using different separation
   reagents was compared, different separation mechanisms were explored,
   and the impacts of a range of parameters, such as the reagent
   concentration, temperature, and liquid solid ratio, on the separation
   time and aluminum loss ratio were studied. Methanoic acid was found to
   be the optimal separation reagent, and the suitable conditions were a
   reagent concentration of 2-4 mol/L, a temperature of 60-80 degrees C,
   and a liquid solid ratio of 30 L/kg. These conditions allowed aluminum
   and polyethylene to be separated in less than 30 min, with an aluminum
   loss ratio of less than 3\%. A mass balance was produced for the
   aluminum polyethylene separation system, and control technique was
   developed to keep the ion concentrations in the reaction system stable.
   This allowed a continuous industrial-scale process for separating
   aluminum and polyethylene to be developed, and a demonstration facility
   with a capacity of 50 t/d was built. The demonstration facility gave
   polyethylene and aluminum recovery rates of more than 98\% and more than
   72\%, respectively. Separating it of aluminum polyethylene composite
   packaging material gave a profit of 1769 Yuan, meaning that an effective
   method for recycling aseptic composite packaging waste was achieved. (C)

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{276}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{In the context of the ``smart city{''}, information and communication
   technologies (ICT) have become indispensable in the planning and design
   of modern municipal solid waste management. Due to more waste varieties,
   there are urgent calls to implement waste classification worldwide,
   which promotes resource recycling to achieve sustainable development. In
   this paper, we present an ICT-based smart waste classification and
   collection system (SWCCS) that is abstracted as a bi-objective
   mathematical programming model to optimize the waste collection problem.
   To implement the proposed SWCCS effectively, we design a novel
   multi-objective hybrid algorithm based on the whale optimization and
   genetic algorithms (MOGWOA) with an improved convergence factor and a
   fast, non-dominated sorting method. A comparison of our algorithm with
   two classical multi-objective algorithms on generated test instances and
   on a real-world case shows that the proposed MOGWOA is more effective
   for optimizing the established model. This paper demonstrates how the
   ICT-based SWCCS works and how it can help sanitation companies improve
   waste collection both economically and environmentally. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Rivers in urban areas have been associated with water quality problems
   because of the practice of discharging untreated domestic and industrial
   waste into the water bodies. However, to what extent the public can
   identify specific environmental problems and whether people are ready to
   cope with potential risks is to a great extent unknown. Public
   environmental awareness of factors underpinning the pollution of rivers
   and approaches for reducing it were studied in Rasht City of Guilan
   Province in northern Iran, with Zarjub and Goharrud rivers as a case
   study. Data were collected from residents on the banks of the studied
   rivers using a questionnaire. Industrial areas, hospitals, and poultry
   farms were perceived as the main factors deteriorating water pollution
   of Zarjub and Goharrud rivers in Guilan Province. The discharge of urban
   sewage into the rivers was the second most important polluting factor.
   Most residents on the banks of Zarjub and Goharrud rivers showed high
   interest in the conservation of the environment. Overall, 62.7\% of the
   residents had moderate, 20\% had high, and 4\% had very high
   environmental awareness. Families and mass media (TV and radio) were
   perceived of being the most important sources of information of family
   members concerning environmental awareness. According to the residents,
   the main approach for alleviating the pollution of Zarjub and Goharrud
   rivers were creating green spaces, dredging the rivers, establishing a
   water purifying system, and establishing a waste incinerator with a
   separation system (based on municipal planning). The public in the study
   area appeared well prepared to cope with the risks of water pollution,
   but further improving environmental awareness of the community can be a
   first step for preventing environmental degradation. The positive
   attitudes of the residents towards environmental conservation, the use
   of proper information sources, and practical training in the context of
   extension services can be effective in conserving water resources in
   urban areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{When assessing the environmental and human health impact of a municipal
   food waste (FW) management system waste managers typically rely on the
   principles of the waste hierarchy; using metrics such as the mass or
   rate of waste that is `prepared for recycling: `recovered forenergy,' or
   `sent to landfill.' These metrics measure the collection and sorting
   efficiency of a waste system but are incapable of determining the
   efficiency of a system to turn waste into a valuable resource. In this
   study a life cycle approach was employed using a system boundary that
   includes the entire waste service provision from collection to safe
   end-use or disposal. A life cycle inventory of seven waste management
   systems was calculated, including the first service wide inventory of FW
   management through kitchen in-sink disposal (food waste disposer).
   Results describe the mass, energy and water balance of each system along
   with key emissions profile. It was demonstrated that the energy balance
   can differ significantly from its' energy generation, exemplified by
   mechanical biological treatment, which was the best system for
   generating energy from waste but only 5th best for net-energy
   generation. Furthermore, the energy balance of kitchen in-sink disposal
   was shown to be reduced because 31\% of volatile solids were lost in
   pretreatment. The study also confirmed that higher FW landfill diversion
   rates were critical for reducing many harmful emissions to air and
   water. Although, mass-balance analysis showed that the alternative
   end-use of the FW material may still contain high impact pollutants.

Abstract = {{With the rapid increase of municipal solid waste (MSW), the phenomenon
   of waste siege exists all over the world. To solve this problem, waste
   classification is wildly applied. Previous studies have shown that
   residents' support for laws and policies, as a critical factor, is often
   conducive to waste classification. At present, governments around the
   world have enacted waste classification laws and policies (WCLP) for MSW
   reduction. In order to construct a sound WCLP system, we analyzed and
   compared the typical WCLP systems of the United States, Japan and China.
   It shows that these three countries are focused on making laws and/or
   policies according to their own national conditions or specific
   situations. A more general legal system for the waste classification in
   various countries has been summarized. It would be beneficial to the
   thorny problem solving of waste siege faced by most of the countries and

Abstract = {{This paper examines how and to what degree government policies of
   garbage fees and voluntary source separation programs, with free indoor
   containers and garbage bags, can affect the effectiveness of municipal
   solid waste (MSW) management, in the sense of achieving a desirable
   reduction of per capita MSW generation. Based on city-level panel data
   for years 1998-2012 in China, our empirical analysis indicates that per
   capita MSW generated is increasing with per capita disposable income,
   average household size, education levels of households, and the lagged
   per capita MSW. While both garbage fees and source separation programs
   have separately led to reductions in per capita waste generation, the
   interaction of the two policies has resulted in an increase in per
   capita waste generation due to the following crowding-out effects:
   Firstly, the positive effect of income dominates the negative effect of
   the garbage fee. Secondly, there are crowding-out effects of mandatory
   charging system and the subsidized voluntary source separation on per
   capita MSW generation. Thirdly, small subsidies and tax punishments have
   reduced the intrinsic motivation for voluntary source separation of MSW.
   Thus, compatible fee charging system, higher levels of subsidies, and
   well-designed public information and education campaigns are required to
   promote household waste source separation and reduction.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to analyse the evolution of the municipal solid
   waste management system of Joao Pessoa (Brazil), which was one of the
   Brazilian pioneers cities in implementing door-to-door selective
   collection programmes, in order to analyse the effect of policy
   decisions adopted in last decade with regard to selective collection. To
   do it, this study focuses on analysing the evolution, from 2005 to 2015,
   of the environmental performance of the municipal solid waste management
   (MSWM) system implemented in different sorting units with selective
   collection programmes by applying the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
   methodology and using as a starting point data collected directly from
   the different stakeholders involved in the MSWM system.
   This article presents the temporal evolution of environmental indicators
   measuring the environmental performance of the MSWM system implemented
   in Joao Pessoa by sorting unit, for each stage of the life cycle of the
   waste (collection, classification, intermediate transports, recycling
   and landfilling), for each waste fraction and for each collection method
   (selective collection or mixed collection), with the aim of identifying
   the key aspects with the greatest environmental impact and their causes.
   Results show on one hand, that environmental behaviour of waste
   management in a door-to-door selective collection programme
   significantly improves the behaviour of the overall waste management
   system. Consequently, the potential to reduce the existing environmental
   impact based on citizens' increased participation in selective
   collection is evidenced, so the implementation of awareness-raising
   campaigns should be one of the main issues of the next policies on solid
   waste. On the other hand, increasing the amount of recyclable wastes
   collected selectively, implementing alternative methods for valorising
   the organic fraction (compost/biomethanization) and improving the
   efficiency of the transportation stage by means of optimizing vehicles
   or routes, are essential actions to reduce the overall net environmental
   impact generated by the MSWM system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Magnetite, nickel and cobalt ferrites were prepared and encapsulated
   within graphitic shells, resulting in three hybrid magnetic graphitic
   nanocomposites. Screening experiments with a 4-nitrophenol aqueous model
   system (5 g L-1) allowed to select the best performing catalyst, which
   was object of additional studies with the liquid effluent resulting from
   a mechanical biological treatment plant for municipal solid waste. Due
   to its high content in bicarbonates (14350 mg L-1) and chlorides (2833
   mg L-1), controlling the initial pH was a crucial step to maximize the
   performance of the catalytic wet peroxide oxidation (CWPO) treatment.
   The catalyst load was 0.5 g L-1, a very low dosage when compared to the
   high chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the effluent - 9206 mg L-1. At the
   optimum operating pH (i.e., pH = 6), ca. 95\% of the aromaticity was
   converted and ca. 55\% of COD and total organic carbon (TOC) of the
   liquid effluent was removed. The biodegradability of the liquid effluent
   was enhanced during the treatment by CWPO, as reflected by the 2-fold
   increase of the five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) to COD ratio
   (BOD5/COD), namely from 0.21 (indicating non-biodegradability) to 0.42
   (suggesting biodegradability of the treated wastewater). In addition,
   the treated water revealed no toxicity against selected bacteria.
   Lastly, a magnetic separation system was designed for in-situ catalyst
   recovery after the CWPO reaction stage. The high catalyst stability was
   demonstrated through five reaction/separation sequential experiments in
   the same vessel with consecutive catalyst reuse. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{An intensive population growth, progressing social and economic
   development processes and growing urbanization of rapidly developing
   countries significantly translate into an increase in the amount of
   generated waste. At present, approx. 12 million tons of waste are
   produced in Poland. It should be expected that this amount will grow
   together with civilization progress. The amount of waste generated per
   person per year in Poland is 330 kg, as compared with approx. 550 kg in
   Germany. If these values are reached, approx. 20 million tons of waste
   will be produced in Poland. This makes it necessary to make rational
   decisions in the area of waste management in urban agglomerations. For
   this reason, in recent years, a growing interest has been observed in
   issues connected with the selection of appropriate planning strategies
   for waste management processes. Waste management plans assume, amongst
   other things, a reduction in the amount of waste intended for
   neutralization, encouraging recycling and creation of preferences to
   increase the share of recovery processes and recycling, in particular.
   One of the global targets involves the preparation of appropriate waste
   recycling strategies, which will increase its effectiveness by improved
   separation at the source, collection and recycling of priority waste
   streams. Poland's environmental policy assumes the organization of a
   municipal waste pre-selection, sorting and recovery system to assure
   that no more 50\% of household waste reaches landfills. One of the most
   important elements of waste management system is a subsystem of planning
   and execution of waste collection process. Issues related to this
   process (determination of the areas of operation, planning vehicle
   routes, factors affecting the process, etc.) are widely discussed in the
   literature. The main goal of this article is to present method for
   assessing the process of planning and execution of municipal waste
   collection. The developed method will allow the assessment of the
   process of waste collection which takes into account the impact of
   external factors and decisions taken during the planning of the service
   areas. The developed method will be verified based on data from real
   waste management system.}},

Abstract = {{In this article the issue of need of using a system approach when
   cleaning garbage, from the urbanized territories is considered. The
   garbage problem in the urbanized territories is one of urgent ones for
   today. The most widely used ways of cleaning (destruction) of garbage is
   its burial in the grounds As a result, big territories are occupied with
   such grounds and cannot be used, in addition, the impact on the
   environment is made. In the paper the use of a system approach, which
   consists in sorting of garbage at the stage of collecting municipal
   solid waste of the urbanized territories, creation of transport -
   logistic schemes on the transportation of garbage to the places of their
   necessary further processing, is offered. The system approach feature
   consists in the preliminary analysis of factors on the basis of which a
   more probable composition and volume of municipal solid waste is defined
   and the system of cleaning of municipal solid waste from the concrete
   urbanized territory is developed.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid growth of urban economy and population in China, the
   output of municipal solid waste (MSW) has dramatically increased
   becoming a constant threat to residents' living environment and health.
   The classification intention of residents plays a pivotal role in
   solving the problem of MSW disposal. While numerous studies have
   examined the classification behavior of MSW from the perspective of
   ordinary residents and households, few studies have attempted to
   understand young people's sorting intention. The novelty of this
   research is to explore the determinants that affect young people's
   intention toward municipal solid waste sorting (MSWS) by extending the
   predictive factors of environmental concern and personal moral
   obligation into the theory of planned behavior (TPB). A sample of 524
   young respondents from Hebei Province in China were used to conduct a
   structural equation model (SEM) validation. The empirical results
   revealed that, according to the rankings of significance, personal moral
   obligation, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norm had
   positive influences on young people's intention toward MSWS, while
   attitude and environmental concern did not. Furthermore, the multi-group
   comparison showed that, compared with the male and rural group, the
   intention of female and urban respondents to classify MSW was not
   affected by subjective norms. Some targeted managerial implications were
   ultimately proposed to promote young people's intention toward MSWS.
   This study contributes to the existing knowledge system of MSWS by
   revealing the classification intention of young people as a group. The
   findings and implications provide the government with useful insights
   for encouraging young people to actively participate in MSWS.}},

Abstract = {{The European regulation of biodegradable municipal waste (biowaste)
   treatment places a significant demand on local biowaste separation
   systems and consequent treatment (composting, anaerobic digestion). When
   implementing separate collection systems, there is a public demand for
   systems based on containers and bags. Based on a case study of the city
   Usti nad Labem in the Czech Republic, the authors illustrate the
   difficulties encountered in the implementation of this kind of system. A
   series of factors should be paramount in the organization of biowaste
   separate collection, including the location of containers, the amount of
   contaminants, and system parameters (e.g. volume of containers,
   frequency of collection). The results obtained confirm how a
   precision-targeted information campaign may contribute towards reducing
   contamination of biowaste container content. Lower amounts of
   contaminants imply a simplified biowaste treatment (composting) and
   increased system efficiency. Furthermore, it was observed that the
   relocation of biowaste containers, or placing of additional containers
   in the system, resulted in an increase in public involvement as a result
   of the added convenience of separate collection proximity of containers.
   The equipment of the chosen city district by additional 55 containers
   increases the number of address points covered by the system by approx.
   149.20\% and the number of inhabitants by about 38.14\%. However, this
   added convenience of separate collection is not cost-neutral, with the
   increased proximity of containers contributing towards a rise in
   collection costs including transport, and containers. The increase of
   collection costs ranges between 105.5 and 156.78\% in comparison with
   the current situation.}},

Abstract = {{Modern world meets a lot of challenges that includes smart waste
   management system. It becomes a big concern if proper disposal system is
   not managed. Managing of waste effectively and recycling efficiently is
   a major goal for every nation. There are many automatic waste material
   sorting facilities available, which are being used to sort metals,
   plastics and glass bottle wastes. Sorting plastics based on type of
   plastics, makes the plastics recycling process more effective. But
   segregation and sorting of black coloured plastics is a major problem
   while sorting plastics based on their types. Also, black plastics
   contains many harmful chemicals like bromide and other heavy metals,
   which may contaminate other recycling processes of plastics. Black
   plastics are used as food containers which leads to serious health
   concern. In this research work, the difficulty of sorting black plastics
   is done by developing an electromechanical system using microcontroller,
   which sorts all types of plastics. For sorting black plastic wastes,
   calibrated sensors and optimized algorithms have been developed and
   used. This sorting process makes plastics recycling process more
   effective. This automatic sorting machine and effective recycling of
   domestic wastes will make our environment more suitable for living.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a technical method to monitor the water distribution
   pipelines against leakage and to control the pump when the water level
   decreases in the tank. Water leakage is the most popular cause of water
   wasted in the domestic water distribution systems. Nowadays most people
   have their smartphone nearby them; therefore, adding an interface on the
   smartphone to control an automated system is a big plus. Energy saving
   is a benefit of the Optimization Water Leakage Detection (OWLD) system.
   It enables us to save energy, time and cost by having smart leakage
   detection in pipelines, measuring the water level in the tank and
   controlling the pump when the water level is low. This paper focuses
   mainly on two parts: The first part is an alarm based on Global System
   for Mobile technology (GSM) to send a Short Message Service (SMS) to the
   owner. This is made up of the following components: sensors, GSM Module,
   Arduino and relays to control the device. The second is the controlling
   part; it uses android application mobile to control the pump. The
   proposed system can effectively improve the efficiency of operation,
   reduce delay time and cost of maintenance pipelines after leakage

Abstract = {{The main aim of this study was to examine residents' environmental
   behavior in sorting solid household waste, and to identify the
   integrative factors that contribute to their waste-separation
   cooperation and other related pro-environmental behaviors. This was
   achieved based on a questionnaire survey in Shenyang, Chengdu, and
   Shanghai. Methodologically, we applied a discrete choice model to
   examine whether individuals' garbage sorting behaviors differ based on
   their characteristics, social attributes, residential circumstances, and
   environmental awareness, and whether these factors are correlated with
   individuals' receptiveness to a refuse charge system, or to policies
   requiring garbage sorting. We further examined whether individuals'
   garbage sorting behavior, their receptiveness to fee-based waste
   collection, and their receptiveness to policies requiring garbage
   sorting differ across areas. In this particular survey, we introduced a
   16 item scale of pro-environmental behavior and a nine item scale of
   altruism to ascertain the ways in which internal motivational factors
   affect people's environmentally conscious voluntary behavior. Overall,
   the present work is expected to contribute to an important understanding
   of the motivational forces and incentives behind human pro-environmental
   behavior and action. It also brings relevance to the analysis of moral
   solidarity in relation to the household waste disposal problems
   currently confronting us today.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an application of a multi-objective optimization
   algorithm (i.e., the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II
   {[}NSGA-II]) and a fuzzy expert system (FES) to allocate municipal waste
   capacities to recycling, aerobic composting, incinerator, and landfill
   facilities with these objectives: (1) minimization of the economic cost;
   and (2) minimization of the environmental cost of the municipal solid
   waste management system. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II
   is used to find multi-objective solutions, and a FES is employed for the
   environmental cost evaluation. Tehran, the capital of Iran, is selected
   as the case study. In the proposed model, the quantitative and
   qualitative aspects of the municipal solid waste management issue are
   taken into account so that the economic and environmental objectives
   that typically arise in cities in this regard can be considered. To
   achieve economic and environmental cost objectives, five scenarios with
   different economic and environmental costs and four solid waste
   management methods (recycling, aerobic composting, incinerator, and
   landfill) are employed. The results show that while hybrid methods for
   municipal waste management can be used, recycling and aerobic composting
   are the principal methods-that is, the scenarios that utilized higher

Title = {Sustainability and Waste Imports in China: Pollution Haven or Resources
   Hunting},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Motivations behind a country's importation of waste are categorized into
   the pollution haven hypothesis (PHH) and the resource hunting hypothesis
   (RHH). The importation of wastes can lead to environmental
   sustainability concerns, requiring governments to intervene when the
   market fails to reduce the negative externalities by strengthening and
   implementing environmental regulations. Motivated by China's position
   within a rapidly growing but environmentally damaging sector of trade,
   this paper has three goals: (1) to classify the primary hypothesis that
   governs China's flow of traded wastes; (2) to verify the heterogeneous
   impact of the pollution paradise motivation and resource demand
   motivation of waste imports from developed and developing countries, and
   across industries; (3) to assess the impact of domestic environmental
   regulations on the motives behind China's waste imports. Using 28
   imported waste-varieties from 20 of China's major trade partners across
   24 years, findings indicate that the flow of Chinese waste imports is
   relatively unresponsive under the pollution haven effect. However, the
   resource hunting effect from developing countries is significantly
   greater than what originates from developed countries, despite the laws
   of 2011 and 2017 established to restrict resource hunting activities.
   These results have important implications for improving the efficiency
   of China's waste sorting and recycling systems.}},

Volume = {{71}},

Pages = {{309-320}},
Abstract = {{The whole complex of soil properties formed during a long process of
   evolution is used in soil diagnostics. Following the genetic approach,
   which proposes the designation of a specific diagnostic horizon that
   represents stages of specific urban synlitogenic soil formation on thick
   human-made deposits, we face the problem of separating truly soil
   horizons from layers of man-made deposits, as both contain significant
   amounts of artefacts. In addition, they have similar chemical and
   physical-chemical properties corresponding to general geochemical
   characteristics of the urban environment. A comparative analysis of
   morphological and physical characteristics was conducted for several
   soils of loamy texture within the city of Moscow, Russia. Their
   morphological descriptions were accompanied by determinations of bulk
   density, saturated hydraulic conductivity and penetration resistance.
   For the analysis of morphological and physical properties, soil
   diagnostic horizons were arranged in four groups (synlithogenic urbic
   humus horizons, postlithogenic humus horizons, technogenic layers and
   horizons inherited from natural texturally-differentiated soils). Most
   of the studied soil profiles had significant contents of solid
   inclusions (domestic waste and building rubble) that allowed us to
   define them as Urbic Technosols, according to the WRB soil
   classification system. It was confirmed that, in addition to specific
   chemical and morphological properties, man-made urban soils had specific
   physical characteristics. The abundance of inclusions of building rubble
   and domestic waste had a strong influence on physical properties such as
   bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Heterogeneous
   distribution of such properties within urban soil profiles could be
   considered as their characteristic feature. As a result, this study
   confirmed the identification of certain diagnostic horizons by
   establishing statistically significant differences in their bulk
   densities and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Penetration resistance
   was shown to be a less informative parameter in this study. We believe
   that more data on physical properties of different types of horizons
   should be accumulated for making it possible to establish typical values
   of physical characteristics of such horizons.}},

Abstract = {{Odor nuisance related to municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal is one of
   the main incentives to counter the Not-In-My-Backyard Syndrome.
   Moreover, integrated odor management contributes to specific odor
   control at different waste treatment stages. In this study, odor
   emissions along typical MSW streams were categorized based on their
   olfactive and environmental impacts after a field investigation of the
   residential district (RD), transfer station (TS), and landfill (LF) in
   the Chongming Eco-island. It was found that odorants, especially NH3 and
   sulfides, increased along the MSW stream, with total chemical
   concentration increasing from 1241.5 +/- 235.6 to 6947.2 +/- 1726.8 mu
   g/m(3). Source separation and co-landfill system, which premixes the MSW
   with bottom ash (BA) at a ratio of 5:1, were speculated to efficiently
   attenuate odorants. Sulfides reduced owing to an increase in trace metal
   dissolution and carbon source consumption with the addition of BA at the
   LF, whereas NH3 in the leachate pond increased due to enhanced
   biodegradation and alkalinity. Photochemical ozone formation (6.7 x
   10(-8)-8.6 x 10(-5) personal equivalent, PE), nutrient enrichment (5.4 x
   10(-8)-4.6 x 10(-5) PE), and acidification (4.8 x 10(-8)-4.1 x 10(-5)
   PE) were the major environmental impact categories. The priority odor
   pollutants screened using ternary fuzzy synthetic system could reflect
   the impact of olfaction and environment and greatly varied along the

Abstract = {{Optimum municipal solid waste (MSW) management system is an essential
   aspect to be considered. Optimal MSW management system could incur high
   cost of investment related to its construction, operation, and
   maintenance. The optimal configurations of the technologies within the
   system are of high importance, especially in developing countries due to
   the limitation on financial support. There are still limited studies on
   the integration of the possible configurations of the selected MSW
   management, which are centralized, clustered, and decentralized, in
   addition to location planning. A cost optimization model with the
   consideration of location planning is developed to identify the optimal
   configuration of the MSW management system with technologies considered
   such as landfilling, composting, refuse derived fuel, and reuse and
   recycling. The configuration considered in the study includes a
   centralized system, where all waste is gathered in a specific location
   and treated. The second configuration is the clustered system, where
   zones are identified, and waste treatment center is built in each zone.
   Finally, the decentralized, where smaller treatment centers are built at
   each village. The case study took place at the Desoq District, Kafr El
   Sheikh, Egypt. It is inhabited with a population of about 0.5 M capita.
   Fifteen scenarios are generated to account for the different combination
   of system configurations and the type of waste treatment and disposal
   unit. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed to
   perform the optimization. The results showed that increasing in the type
   and degree of treatment increases the net profit. This means that the
   incorporation of sorting, recycling, composting and RDF production leads
   to higher profit compared to landfilling only. The centralized systems
   turned out to attain more net profit than decentralized and clustered
   systems. The optimum scenario with maximum net profit value was the
   centralized system with sorting, composting, waste to energy facilities,
   and one landfill with a net profit of 3.864 USD/t/d. The optimal
   location for such centralized system is identified to be located beside
   Desoq wastewater treatment plant and between Desoq and Sanhour cities.
   The same model can be applied to other rural areas in developing
   countries.}},

Abstract = {{Managing municipal solid waste is a major concern for cities around the
   world. Particularly urban communities with developing economies are
   urged to improve their waste management practices, and set up
   appropriate waste management systems. Waste management is a
   city-specific topic; there is no ideal solution that can be
   operationalized everywhere. In developing cities, municipalities and
   decision makers need simple and effective indicators to assess the
   sustainability of their current waste management systems, and set a
   performance reference point. The current study investigates available
   literature and suggests a list of measurable sustainability indicators
   which are specific to solid-waste management. The list encompasses 27
   indicators that cover the building blocks of an integrated solid-waste
   management system, i.e., collection and sorting, recycling, composting,
   energy recovery, and landfilling. An assessment tool is developed
   through a five-point Likert scale, evaluating these indicators. Case
   studies of Cairo and Brussels were analyzed. The outcomes of this
   analysis can be used as a benchmark on a local level in planning,
   clarifying policy objectives, and setting priorities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyses mass and energy balances of some Integrated
   Municipal Solid Waste Systems (IMSWS) focusing on MSW sorting, treatment
   and energy recovery conversion chains suitable for the last entries into
   the European Union (EU). In particular the Romanian case-study has been
   developed as reference scenario. In this context the actions timelines
   for the case-study are immediate (S-1A), midterm (S-1B) and long term
   (S2). In the scenarios S-1A, S-1B a poor selective collection (SC) is
   considered of 3.5\% and 9.94\% respectively from the total MSW stream.
   The Residual Municipal Solid Waste (RMSW) is always sent to a bio-drying
   process. Advanced mechanical sorting (AMS) treatments are applied in
   order to obtain Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF). A final industrial
   exploitation of SRF (S-1A) or a gasification option (S-1B) are
   considered as final treatments. Scenario S-2 includes a proficient SC
   implementation for paper and cardboard, plastics, glass, metals and
   wood, ``Take back programs{''}, RMSW bio-drying, and SRF gasification.
   For the development of the calculations, one million tons of MSW were
   considered. The results show that the combination of proficient SC and,
   Take back programs{''} leads to a significant decrease in the annual
   waste disposal. Moreover the combustible material designated to energy
   recovery (S-1A cement factory, S-1B and S-2 gasification) decreases by
   weight (S-1A (53.7\%), S-1B (55.84\%) and S-2 (65.45\%). In particular,
   without any pre-treatment (SC, Take back programs, mechanical sorting)
   of the RMSW stream by applying the its direct incineration, the Non
   Volatile Solids (NVS) landfill flow would be higher in comparison with
   all scenarios considered.}},

Abstract = {{Municipal solid waste incineration fly ash is directly landfilled after
   solidification in the industry. The rapid evaluation of contaminant
   leaching is required before the landfill of fly ash. In order to reduce
   the time to evaluate the effect of solidification, a set of rapid
   evaluation method was developed through the determination of
   characteristic index, heavy metal leaching analysis, principal component
   analysis, and mathematical model construction. It was found that f-CaO,
   acid neutralizing capacity, pH and soluble calcium were negatively
   correlated with heavy metal leaching. The soluble chlorine was
   positively correlated with heavy metal leaching. The effect of each
   feature indicators on heavy metal leaching was evaluated using principal
   component analysis and mathematical analysis software R.3.4.4.
   Furthermore, R.3.4.4 was used to detect the optimal model and the excess
   probability formula by stepwise linear regression and logistic
   regression analysis method. By introducing the measured value of feature
   indicator into the excess probability formula, the rate of
   excess-standard of heavy metals leaching can be preliminarily

   Total lipid yield for the Chlorella-rich biomass was 21.4 +/- 2.02\%.
   Such high biomass lipid content demonstrates the potential for obtaining

Title = {Three rights separation: China's proposed rural land rights reform and
   four types of local trials},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{111-121}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{China's central government is promoting a new round of land reform in
   its rural areas, the core of which is the so-called `three rights
   separation system'. In attempting to achieve the double goals of
   developing agriculture and maintaining the basic stability of rural
   society, central policy makers want to separate the original household
   right of contractual operation into a contractual right (right of
   disposal) and an operation right. When formally adopted, these two
   rights, combined with the village collective ownership, will constitute
   China's new structure of farmland rights. Many local governments are
   already using practical approaches involving the separation of the three
   rights, providing a valuable reference for its formalization in the
   future.
   In this paper, we analyze four relevant existing approaches by case
   studies of four representative projects. The results show that, while
   all four have in different ways reached the goal of increased scale of
   farmland operations, all are facing different contradictions and
   conflicts among the collectives, local governments and farmers, due to
   different farmland interests, demands and endowment problems. In
   response, a new framework is developed involving three rights
   separation, entailing some new meanings. This involves the repositioning
   of the four leading players in the distribution of farmland rights the
   state, collective, part-time farmers and professional farmers in order
   to realize the free transfer, monetization and redistribution of
   farmland rights to meet the demands of all the parties involved. With
   this framework, collective ownership is limited to the management of the
   award and recovery of the contractual right instead of specific
   agricultural operations. The introduction of a contractual right exit
   mechanism encourages the contractual right to be sold back to the
   collective for awarding directly to the professional farmers. In this
   way, the transfer of the operation right to professional farmers is
   encouraged as far as possible to enable them to increase their operating
   area and agricultural income. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Nowadays the mode of periodic maintenance and routine check are adopted
   as the dominating maintenance style of domestic aircraft. However, this
   mode requires a large number of experienced professionals, resulting in
   the waste of manpower and resources. In this paper, taking the flight
   data of a certain type of aircraft as the main data source,, a fault
   diagnosis reasoning expert system based on failure mode is proposed
   through extracting the fault symptom information and the system failure
   mode. The main work of this system is as following :
   1) In this system, The fault tree analysis (FTA) is adopted by the fault
   diagnosis expert system for fault detection of the aircraft. The FTA can
   reduce the difficulty of diagnostic reasoning and knowledge acquisition.
   By combining production-rules and the minimum cuts of the fault tree,
   the fault mode of the aircraft can be effectively extracted; An
   optimized reasoning engine is built based on the fault mode, which
   utilizes the forward reasoning pattern for logical inference.
   2) A fault diagnosis expert system, which is based on failure mode, is
   developed with MFC frame by using MySQL as the database on the Windows 7
   platform. This system has been successfully applied to a certain type of

Abstract = {{The performance of lateritic soil treated with Bacillus coagulans (B.
   Coagulans) was assessed for use as hydraulic barrier material in
   municipal solid waste (MSW) containment use. The soil was classified as
   A-4(2) and SC using AASHTO (American Association of State Highway and
   Transportation Officials) and the Unified Soil Classification System,
   respectively. Index, hydraulic conductivity, calcite content, and
   microanalysis tests were carried out. Soil specimens were treated with
   B. coagulans at one-third pore volume (i.e., the numerical difference
   between the initial degree of saturation before soaking in water and
   final degree of saturation after full saturation of the soil specimens
   in water) in stepped suspension densities of 0, 1.5x108, 6.0x108,
   1.2x109, 1.8x109, and 2.4x109 cells/mL, respectively. Cementation
   reagent was poured on the compacted soil in the mold and allowed to
   percolate until partial saturation was achieved. Compacted specimens
   after treatment were placed in water for 24-48 h and then permeated in
   three sets using water only, water and leachate, and leachate only for a
   total duration of 90 days. Compatibility test results showed reduction
   in long-term hydraulic conductivity values for the different permeation
   regimens considered. Absolute values recorded varied from 7.10x10-10,
   1.04x10-9, and 7.50x10-10 to 1.71x10-9 m/s, 1.69x10-9, and 8.28x10-10m/s
   when permeated with water only, sequentially with water and leachate,
   and with leachate only, respectively, at 0 and 2.4x109 cells/mL,
   respectively. Calcite content increased for specimens permeated with
   water only (i.e., from 4.00\% to 4.80\%) and decreased for specimens
   sequentially permeated with water and leachate (i.e., from 6.60\% to
   4.00\%) and leachate only (i.e., from 4.80\% to 4.00\%). Results of
   chemical compatibility and microanalysis showed that the treated soil is
   compatible with MSW leachate with the exception of a few cases that did
   not meet the minimum permisible hydraulic conducutivity value of
   1.00x10-9 m/s used for landfill purposes.}},

Abstract = {{This study analyses the determinants of household recycling behaviour in
   a recycling system at an early stage of development (Lithuania) and
   compares them with those of a more mature recycling scheme (Sweden). The
   analysis builds on the empirics from household surveys and focuses on
   four fractions of household packaging waste. Several similarities within
   the two recycling schemes were found, including convenience, norm-based
   motivators, and the interactions between such factors. The analysis
   tested and confirmed the so-called ABC Hypothesis of moral norms being
   less important as motivators to recycle when it is easy and convenient
   to collect packaging waste, e.g. when kerbside collection is in place.
   One important difference between the two schemes was that social norms
   were found to be important for source sorting in the early-stage
   recycling system but not in the mature recycling system. This suggests
   not only that more effort should be devoted to shaping social norms that
   facilitate household recycling behaviour when collection systems are
   launched, but also that the focus should be on moral norms when the
   convenience factors in waste management schemes are still
   underdeveloped. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Municipal Solid Waste Incineration (MSWI) fly ash contain large amounts

   The increased amounts of fly ash generated cause environmental issues
   and accumulation of valuable metals in landfills which contribute to an
   increased interests to recognize the ash as an urban mining target of
   metal resources. The high leachability of fly ash metal compounds could
   instead be seen as a benefit since it opens a path for metal recovery.
   This study reports a new potential hydrometallurgical process based on
   combining leaching and sequential solvent extraction to recover copper
   and zinc from MSWI fly ash. The investigations were carried out at bench
   scale and laboratory pilot scale. The pilot scale unit, operated as a
   counter-current mixer-settler system. The separation of copper and zinc
   from the acidic ash leachate was achieved using LIX860N-I and Cyanex
   923, two commercial extraction reagents, respectively. The phase contact
   time to reach equilibrium, number of mixer-settler stages of the system
   and liquid to organic ratios were investigated for optimization. Removal
   of co-extracted metals, e.g. cadmium, iron and lead to obtain higher
   purity of zinc solution, was carried out using either cementation before
   the zinc extraction, or selective stripping with different stripping
   agents sequentially after extraction. An efficient recovery of the
   copper and zinc present in an ash leachate, more than 90\% and 99\%
   respectively, was achieved sequentially in a mixer settler system, which
   comprised of two stages for copper extraction and three stages for zinc
   extraction. Moreover, the removal of the toxic metals lead and cadmium

Abstract = {{Municipal solid waste (MSW), generated at an unprecedented rate due to
   rapid urbanization and industrialization contains useful recyclable
   materials like metals, plastic, wood, etc. Recycling of useful materials
   from MSW in the developing countries is severely constrained by limited
   door-to-door collection and poor means of segregation. Recovery of
   recyclables is usually performed by waste pickers, which is highly risky
   and hazardous for their health. This paper reports the development of a
   robotic mobile manipulation system for automated sorting of useful
   recyclables from MSW. The developed robot is equipped with a thermal
   imaging camera, proximity sensor and a 5-DOF robotic aria. This paper
   presents an approach for sorting based on automated identification from
   thermographic images. The developed algorithm extracts keypoint features
   from the thermographic image and feeds into clustering model to map them
   into a bag of-word vectors. Finally, Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   classifier is used for identifying the recyclable material. We used the
   developed algorithm to detect three categories of recyclables namely,
   aluminum can, plastic bottle and tetra pack from given thermographic
   images. We obtained classification rate of 94.3\% in the tests. In
   future, we plan to extend the developed approach for classifying a wider
   range of recyclable objects as well as to incorporate motion planning
   algorithms to handle cluttered environments.}},

Abstract = {{Considering the social, cultural, economic and environmental structure,
   source-separated collection of recyclable packaging wastes has been a
   huge issue for cosmopolite cities like Istanbul. To provide an effective
   recycling system; all source separation, collection and recycling
   activities should be analyzed environmentally and socially. In the scope
   of this study, existing and alternative municipal packaging waste
   management systems are analyzed and compared in terms of environmental
   and social impacts. The research is mainly based on a long term site
   observation, data collection and existing system analysis. Environmental
   performances of alternative scenarios are calculated based on the
   existing system data, whereas more site observations and interviews with
   stakeholders are conducted for the determination of social impacts. In
   the analysis of both environmental and social impacts of the scenarios,
   life cycle assessment used as a methodological approach. Results of the
   study show that informal collection systems are environmentally more
   effective than the formal collection systems. Even the resource
   consumption is high in these systems; they are still environmentally
   beneficial because of the high material collection rate. On the other
   hand, social impact assessment results indicate that informal collection
   system has serious social disadvantages compared to the formal systems.
   And finally, it is found that environmental and social weaknesses of the
   system could be minimized with integrated system applications.}},

Title = {A proposed framework of food waste collection and recycling for
   renewable biogas fuel production in Hong Kong},
Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{Hong Kong is experiencing a pressing need for food waste management.
   Currently, approximately 3600 tonnes of food waste are disposed of at
   landfills in Hong Kong daily. The landfills in Hong Kong are expected to
   be exhausted by 2020. In the long run, unavoidable food waste should be
   sorted out from the other municipal solid waste (MSW) and then valorized
   into valuable resources. A simple sorting process involving less
   behavioural change of residents is, therefore, of paramount importance
   in order to encourage residents to sort the food waste from other MSW.
   In this paper, a sustainable framework of food waste collection and
   recycling for renewable biogas fuel production is proposed. For an
   efficient separation and collection system, an optic bag (i.e. green
   bag) can be used to pack the food waste, while the residual MSW can be
   packed in a common plastic bag. All the wastes are then sent to the
   refuse transfer stations in the conventional way (i.e. refuse collection
   vehicles). At the refuse transfer stations, the food waste is separated
   from the residual MSW using optic sensors which recognize the colours of
   the bags. The food waste in the optic bags is then delivered to the
   proposed Organic Waste Treatment Facilities, in which biogas is
   generated following the anaerobic digestion technology. The biogas can
   be further upgraded via gas upgrading units to a quality suitable for
   use as a vehicle biogas fuel. The use of biogas fuel from food waste has
   been widely practiced by some countries such as Sweden, France, and
   Norway. Hopefully, the proposed framework can provide the epitome of the
   waste-to-wealth concept for the sustainable collection and recycling of
   food waste in Hong Kong.(c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {A decision support tool for planning biowaste management systems},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{242}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Biowaste is one of the predominant fractions in municipal waste. Its
   easy degradation in the ground causes the emission of polluting gases
   and generates leachate, which pose a great environmental risk. Defining
   solutions for biowaste management may have a number of varied, sometimes
   opposing objectives, and involve several linked stages. This article
   presents a new tool for the planning of biowaste management systems. The
   tool distinguishes four stages within the waste management line:
   collection (defined by the separation model and the collection system),
   pre-treatment, treatment, and application. Several alternatives are
   considered for each stage. The different combinations of alternatives
   that define the management systems are evaluated in two phases. First,
   the compatibility matrix establishes the affinity between the
   alternatives selected for each stage and then each alternative is
   assessed using indicators associated with environmental, social,
   technical and economic criteria. Both management alternatives and
   criteria considered in the tool can be modified or extended according to
   the local circumstances. The paper describes a case study that shows the
   value of the tool as an aid in decision-making for alternative selection
   in waste management systems under different scenarios and priorities.

Abstract = {{Waste is not a rejected item to dispose anymore but increasingly a
   secondary resource to exploit, influencing waste allocation among
   treatment operations in a waste management (WM) system. The aim of this
   methodological paper is to present a new method for the assessment of
   the WM system, the ``analytical method of the waste allocation
   process{''} (AMWAP), based on the concept of the ``waste allocation
   process{''} defined as the aggregation of all processes of apportioning
   waste among alternative waste treatment operations inside or outside the
   spatial borders of a WM system. AMWAP contains a conceptual framework
   and an analytical approach. The conceptual framework includes, firstly,
   a descriptive model that focuses on the description and classification
   of the WM system. It includes, secondly, an explanatory model that
   serves to explain and to predict the operation of the WM system. The
   analytical approach consists of a step-by-step analysis for the
   empirical implementation of the conceptual framework. With its multiple
   purposes, AMWAP provides an innovative and objective modular method to
   analyse a WM system. which may be integrated in the framework of impact
   assessment methods and environmental systems analysis tools. Its
   originality comes from the interdisciplinary analysis of the WAP and to
   develop the conceptual framework. AMWAP is applied in the framework of
   an illustrative case study on the household WM system of Geneva

Abstract = {{Urban waste treatment has become an important part of urban
   environmental governance, and the efficiency of waste classification and
   recycling affects the ecological environment construction of the whole
   city. At present, the urban waste classification and recycling system in
   China is not perfect, and the residents' awareness of waste recycling is
   insufficient, which restricts the urban green ecological development. To
   solve this problem, this paper first analyzes the concept of garbage
   classification and recycling, summarizes the classification and
   recycling process of three commonly used garbage classification methods,
   including terminal classification, front-end rough classification and
   front-end subdivision, and analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of
   each method. This paper puts forward the calculation formula and
   calculation process of waste recycling rate, which provides a
   theoretical basis for the investigation and analysis of waste
   classification. Through the analysis of the statistical data of the
   relevant environmental sanitation departments and the commercial
   departments, it is concluded that in the past 10 years, the amount of
   urban domestic waste recycling has increased year by year, from 35.463
   million tons in 2010 to 56.984 million tons in 2019, with an average
   annual growth rate of about 6\%; The treatment capacity of non
   recyclable waste has gradually decreased since 2014, and it will be
   reduced to 137.89 million tons in 2019; Since 2010, the garbage recovery
   and utilization rate has increased year by year, from 19.6\% in 2010 to
   29.3\% in 2019. The garbage recovery and utilization rate has increased
   significantly. Through questionnaire survey, this paper analyzes the
   main factors affecting garbage collection, and concludes that only
   22.5\% of the residents have a very good knowledge of garbage
   classification, while 38.5\% of the residents have a very poor knowledge
   of garbage classification.}},

Abstract = {{The main aim of this study was to perform a Life cycle assessment study
   as well as an economic evaluation of the recovery of recyclable

   separate erroneously waste fractions, they produce both environmental
   and economic damages. The environmental and economic evaluation was
   performed for the case study of Nola (34.349 inhabitants) in Southern
   Italy, with a kerbside system that assured a source separation of 62\%
   in 2014. The economic analysis provided a quantification of the economic
   benefits obtainable for the population in function of the achievable
   percentage of source separation. The comparison among the environmental
   performance of four considered scenarios showed that the higher the
   level of source separation was, the lower the overall impacts were. This
   occurred because, even if the impacts of the waste collection and
   transport increased, they were overcome by the avoided impacts of the
   recycling processes. Increasing the source separation by 1\% could avoid
   the emission of 5 kg CO2 eq. and 5 g PM10 for each single citizen. The

Abstract = {{The circular economy is gaining growing attention as a way for reducing
   demands on finite raw materials and minimizing negative externalities.
   To attain these goals, new trends on circular economy have been explored
   based on systemic approaches, which require the involvement and
   commitment of different actors, from citizens to policy makers. Plastics
   have been identified as a priority for circular economy implementation,
   since the principles of this economy can significantly contribute to
   optimize material flows and reduce negative externalities, such as
   plastic leakage into oceans. This paper describes an educational project
   that empowers children to reduce waste in schools and strengthens the
   role of end-users in building a more sustainable world. The ReShape IT
   project was designed as a way of encouraging students' participation as
   the key drivers in the value and supply chain of an eco-innovative
   solution for the development of 3D printed educational tools, such as
   world maps, geometric figures, supports for school materials, boards,
   prototypes for specific internal projects, among others, from recycled
   plastics. Students are encouraged to easily separate specific domestic
   waste (HDPE, PET), simply by looking at their recycling codes (1 or 2).
   This waste is the recycled and integrated into educational tools.
   Additionally, students will be granted with `points' convertible into
   discounts in the acquisition of educational materials for the schools.
   It is also a project's ambition to improve the interaction between
   citizens and the different actors in this ``closed-loop{''}, being
   envisaged a strong commitment of municipalities and local communities to
   promote a more efficient use of resources, increasing the awareness on
   the impact of circular economy in sustainability. The project considers
   the implementation of new processes to recover/recycle plastics from
   wastes, modifying the existing collecting and sorting systems (directly
   implemented at schools through a recycling rewards scheme). In this
   sense, it will improve waste collection approaches by encouraging
   behavioural changes and increase public awareness and social involvement
   to promote recycling and enable a greater involvement of end-users, i.e.
   students, their families, and education professionals and
   municipalities. Moreover, the students are engaged in the entire
   recycling process, from the implementation of the collecting schemes,
   the materials processing, to the design of the educational tools. As
   such, the recyclability assessment of recovered plastic waste and
   optimization of converting processes parameters (by 3D printing of
   plastic filament) will be performed to design and manufacture innovative
   educational tools and devices according to the specific needs of the
   end-users (students and schools) and educational requirements. This
   project is therefore aligned with Europe 2020 strategy for the
   Sustainable Growth, by stimulating and engaging the society, in
   particular children and educational professionals, to promote a more
   efficient use of the resources, and mobilizing the industrial symbiosis
   by transforming the plastic waste collected into valuable raw materials
   for the generation of educational tools and devices, ultimately
   fostering the creation of a more sustainably-minded society.}},

Abstract = {{An integrated CO2/O-2 co-gasification system of municipal solid waste
   (MSW) and bituminous coal (BC) with CO2 capture was developed and
   simulated by the Aspen plus, which mainly consisted of three processes:
   air separation unit, co-gasification system, and CO2 absorption unit. In
   addition, raw syngas composition, cold gas efficiency (CGE), and overall
   energy efficiency (OEE) of the entail system were evaluated in detail
   with respect to the main operating parameters (gasification temperature,
   T; oxygen equivalence ratio, R-o; mole of CO2 to carbon ratio, R-c; and
   the MSW blending ratio, R-M). The results indicated that the addition of
   BC improved the gasification of MSW. Higher gasification temperature
   increased CGE and OEE. Increasing the R-c ratio led to the decrease of
   H-2 mole fraction due to the enhanced reverse water-gas shift reaction.
   In addition, the CGE and OEE of the system decreased with increasing
   R-M. From the analyses of the parameters, the most optimal operating
   conditions were set as T = 900 degrees C, R-o = 0.2, R-c = 0.5, and R-M
   = 0.6, and the corresponding OEE of the system reached 0.57. The system
   can achieve a large processing capacity of MSW at the cost of the
   efficiency loss of this condition.}},

Abstract = {{Compared to Intrusive Load Monitoring which uses smart power meters at
   each level to be monitored, Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is an
   ingenious way that relies on signal readings at a single point to deduce
   the share of the devices that have contributed to the overall load. This
   reliable technique that guarantees the safety and privacy of individual
   users has recently become an increasingly popular topic, as it turns out
   to be a major solution to assist household users in the process of
   obtaining details of their electricity consumption. The detailed
   consumption promotes better management of the electrical power on the
   consumer side by helping to eliminate any waste of energy. In this
   paper, an edge gateway has been implemented to safely monitor the
   overall load in a smart energy system. A load separation method has been
   introduced based on events detected on a low-frequency power signal,
   which allows the consumption profile of On/Off and multi-state devices
   to be generated without relying on the knowledge of the cardinality of
   these devices Following the extraction of significant features contained
   in the aggregate signal, an appliance profile recognition approach is
   presented based on the non-parametric Mean Shift algorithm. The ability
   of the proposed method to learn and deduce devices profile is validated
   using the Reference Energy Disaggregation Dataset (REDD). The
   experimental results show that the proposed approach is efficient in
   detecting events of binary state and finite state appliances.}},

   dynamic material flow analysis to quantify the stocks and flows along
   the anthropogenic aluminum cycle in China from 1950 to 2100. Potential
   future changes of significant parameters are explored and identified,
   and around 250 sets of scenario results (including all flows, stocks,
   and losses along the aluminum cycle in China) are obtained for the
   comprehensive scenario analysis. The main findings include: (1) China's
   primary aluminum production will peak at around 40 MMT (million metric
   tons) at around 2025, leading to the end of primary aluminum boom that
   started from the early 1990s; (2) Domestic aluminum demand will continue
   to increase to more than 40 MMT due to the growing accumulation of
   in-use stocks in meeting future societal needs; (3) China's old aluminum
   scrap generation will increase dramatically (around 0.8 MMT per year)
   soon and secondary production will account for more than 60\% of
   aluminum production after 2050s in almost all scenarios. Thus, there
   will be a rapid shifting in production capacity from primary to
   secondary routes. In this context, the corresponding policy should focus
   more on the urban mining, and improvement of end-of-life management
   systems and sorting technologies. These scenario results also reveal key
   opportunities and barriers in the process. Notably, it becomes
   increasingly important for China's and the global aluminum industry to
   investigate China's future role in the global market of primary and
   waste aluminum products. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {Separation of biodegradable material from the low calorific fraction of

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {{2021}},

Abstract = {{The increasing concerns regarding climate change and depletion of raw
   materials motivate governments to intensify their actions towards a
   cleaner energy matrix, independent of fossil fuels, and a more
   sustainable material supply chain. In this context, municipal solid
   waste (MSW) is of major interest, considering it contains a variety of
   potentially valuable materials, such as biomass (e.g. food and green
   waste) and recyclables (e.g. plastics, glass, mineral fractions, etc.).
   However, when suitable local infrastructure for the separation of these
   materials does not exist, MSW is usually discarded in landfills or
   thermally treated. Often, the thermal treatment involves transportation
   over long distances. The objective of this work was to develop a pilot
   mechanical pretreatment system for the separation of MSW (fraction <12
   mm) into a substrate rich in biodegradable material for local
   valorization. The developed pretreatment consists of a sieving step
   followed by a mixing unit, which produces a suspension to be fed into a
   hydrocyclone. The impurity separation efficiency of the hydrocyclone was
   evaluated for different total solids (TS) of the suspension and for
   different volume flows (VF). For practical applications, the TS of 9\%
   and VF of 10 m(3)/h presented the optimal arrangement for impurity
   removal. In addition, after passing the MSW-derived suspension through
   the hydrocyclone three times, it was possible to increase the
   concentration of biodegradable material from 40\% TS to 65\% TS. The
   removed impurities consisted of 90\% minerals, glass and metals,
   presenting potential of further processing for the extraction of
   secondary raw materials prior to landfilling. The specific electricity
   demand of the proposed wet pretreatment was estimated at 3.2 kWh/t of
   MSW <12 mm processed. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The rapidly growing output of solid waste has brought tremendous
   pressure to urban development. China launched an action plan known as
   ``Zero-waste city{''} (ZWC), that refers to an urban development model
   aimed at reducing the generation of and enhancing the recycling of solid
   waste, in order to alleviate environmental impacts. Eleven cities and
   five special zones achieved positive results of solid waste management
   were selected as pilot areas for exploring empirical methods until 2019.
   The practices and lessons of the pilot cities need to be deeply analyzed
   and summarized, so as to promote successful models, learn lessons and
   better implement the policy comprehensively for other cities. This study
   presents a review of China's ZWC policies and practices with
   constructive suggestions for further development. Based on the policy
   objective of ZWC and the field investigation of solid waste flow, five
   crucial approaches to developing ZWC are proposed, namely, solid waste
   reduction throughout the industrial chain, collaborative treatment of
   classified municipal solid waste (MSW), efficient utilization of
   agricultural waste with multiple purposes, safety control of hazardous
   waste flow, and optimization of market mechanisms. The case study
   demonstrates that the five paths are appropriate to Xuzhou city.
   However, deficiencies in MSW classification, pesticide packaging waste
   collection systems, solid waste product application, management, and
   policymaking, have emerged. Regulatory prohibitions, extended producer
   responsibility and market vitality should be adopted to improve the
   collection, transportation, and utilization of solid waste. Key findings
   from this research are to summarize crucial paths toward fulfiling ZWC
   goal, and to reveal some successful practices of, and lessons from ZWC
   construction by case studies. This study provides a method to further
   implement zero solid waste management in a targeted manner. The
   recommendations drawn from the study, which include law, market and
   institutional measures, may contribute to the achievement of developing
   sustainable cities.}},

   and changes in exposure to bioaerosols at materials recovery facilities},
Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{47-55}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to assess how extending the sorting
   instructions for plastic packaging would affect the exposure of workers
   working at materials recovery facility (MRF) to dust, endotoxins, fungi
   and bacteria, taking into consideration other factors that could have an
   influence on this exposure. Personal sampling was carried out at four
   MRFs during six sampling campaigns at each facility, both in sorting
   rooms and when the workers were involved in ``mobile tasks{''} away from
   the rooms. The data was analysed by describing the extension of sorting
   instructions both using a qualitative variable (after vs before) and
   using data for the pots and trays recycling stream, including or
   excluding plastic film.
   Overall, before the extension of the sorting guidelines, the geometric
   mean of personal exposure levels in sorting rooms was 0.3 mg/m3 for
   dust, 27.7 EU/m(3) for endotoxins, 13,000 CFU/m(3) for fungi and 1800
   CFU/m(3) for bacteria. When workers were involved in mobile tasks away
   from the rooms, these averages were 0.5 mg/m(3), 25.7 EU/m(3), 28,000
   CFU/m(3) and 5100 CFU/m(3) respectively. The application by households
   of instructions to include pots, trays and film with other recyclable
   plastic packaging led to an increase in exposure to endotoxins, fungi
   and bacteria at MRFs. For an increase of 0.5 kg per inhabitant per year
   in the pots, trays and film recycling stream, exposure in sorting rooms
   rose by a factor of 1.4-2.2, depending on the biological agent. Exposure
   during mobile tasks increased by a factor of 3.0-3.6 .The age of the
   waste amplified the effect of the extension of sorting instructions on
   exposure to fungi, bacteria and endotoxins. Factors that had a
   significant influence on the exposure of workers to dust and/or
   bioaerosols included the presence of paper, newspapers and magazines in
   the sorted waste, the order in which incoming waste was treated and the
   quality of the ventilation system in the sorting rooms.
   The levels of exposure observed in this study highlight the need to
   implement appropriate preventive measures against bioaerosols at MRFs
   for dry waste. There are grounds to justify these preventive measures,
   both inside sorting rooms and for the MRF as a whole, regardless of
   whether the decision to extend sorting instructions for household
   plastic waste is adopted. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{513-523}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The SEMIZENTRAL approach is an infrastructure solution for the
   challenges of high growth dynamics and resource scarcity in fast growing
   urban areas. The integration of water, wastewater, waste, and energy in
   one system increases resource efficiency. District-wise realization
   enables the infrastructure system to grow at the same rate as the city.
   The concept has been realized for the first time on a scale of 12,000
   population equivalent in Qingdao, China. Greywater and blackwater are
   collected separately; treated greywater is reused for toilet flushing.
   Reclaimed blackwater is used for irrigation. The analyses of the
   wastewater composition reveal significant differences in comparison to
   design values as well as to literature values for greywater and
   blackwater. Unexpected user behaviour, as well as cross-connections, are
   likely reasons. The greywater and blackwater treatment processes in the
   Resource Recovery Center were adapted to the influent's characteristics,
   so that legal effluent limits are fulfilled, despite changes in influent
   quality. Small systems often show higher influent variability. Design
   data for systems with source separation are still lacking. Measurement
   campaigns in areas similar to the planning area are recommendable, but
   might not always be possible. In addition, there is a risk of
   cross-connections between blackwater and greywater, though this can be
   reduced. For these reasons, there is (possibly high) uncertainty
   regarding design values for greywater and blackwater. Correspondingly,
   the treatment processes need to be designed flexibly. For future
   implementation, technical risks deriving from source separation have to
   be weighed against the expected higher acceptance of reuse of treated
   greywater in households. Intra-urban reuse of total wastewater, in
   combination with extensive public relations programs, might be an
   alternative.}},

Journal = {APPLIED SPECTROSCOPY},
Year = {{2022}},
Volume = {{76}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen chloride (HCl) monitoring during combustion/gasification of
   biomass fuels and municipal solid waste, such as polyvinyl chloride
   (PVC) and food residues, is demanded to avoid the adverse effect of HCl
   to furnace operation and to improve the quality of the gas products.
   Infrared tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (IR-TDLAS) is a
   feasible nonintrusive in-situ method for HCl measurements in harsh
   environments. In the present work, the measurement was performed using
   the R(3) line of the nu(2) vibrational band of HCl at 5739.25 cm(-1)
   (1742.4 nm). Water vapor is ubiquitous in combustion/gasification
   environments, and its spectral interference is one of the most common
   challenges for IR-TDLAS. Spectral analysis based on the current
   well-known databases was found to be insufficient to achieve an accurate
   measurement. The lack of accurate temperature-dependent water spectra
   can introduce thousands parts per million (ppm) HCl overestimation. For
   the first time, accurate spectroscopic data of temperature-dependent
   water spectra near 5739.3 cm(-1) were obtained based on a systematic
   experimental investigation of the hot water lines in a well-controlled,
   hot flue gas with a temperature varying from 1100 to 1950 K. With the
   accurate knowledge of hot water interference, the HCl TDLAS system can
   achieve a detection limit of about 100 ppm . m at around 1500 K, and
   simultaneously the gas temperature can be derived. The technique was
   applied to measure the temporally resolved HCl release and local
   temperature over burning PVC particles in hot flue gas at 1790 K.}},

Abstract = {{Unconventional oil and gas residual solid wastes are generally disposed
   in municipal waste landfills (RCRA Subtitle D), but they contain
   valuable raw materials such as proppant sands. A novel process for
   recovering raw materials from hydraulic fracturing residual waste is
   presented. Specifically, a novel hydroacoustic cavitation system,
   combined with physical separation devices, can create a distinct stream
   of highly concentrated sand, and another distinct stream of clay from
   the residual solid waste by the dispersive energy of cavitation
   conjoined with ultrasonics, ozone and hydrogen peroxide. This
   combination cleaned the sand grains, by removing previously aggregated
   clays and residues from the sand surfaces. When these unit operations
   were followed by a hydrocyclone and spiral, the solids could be
   separated by particle size, yielding primarily cleaned sand in one flow
   stream; clays and fine particles in another; and silts in yet a third
   stream. Consequently, the separation of particle sizes also affected
   radium distribution - the sand grains had low radium activities, as lows
   as 0.207 Bq g(-1) (5.6 pCi g(-1)). In contrast, the clays had elevated
   radium activities, as high as 1.853.7 Bq g(-1) (50-100 pCi g(-1)) - and
   much of this radium was affiliated with organics and salts that could be
   separated from the clays. We propose that the reclaimed sand could be
   reused as hydraulic fracturing proppant. The separation of sand from
   silt and clay could reduce the volume and radium masses of wastes that
   are disposed in landfills. This could represent a significant savings to
   facilities handling oil and gas waste, as much as \$100 000-300 000 per
   year. Disposing the radium-enriched salts and organics downhole will
   mitigate radium release to the surface. Additionally, the reclaimed sand
   could have market value, and this could represent as much as a third of
   the cost savings. Tests that employed the toxicity characteristic
   leaching protocol (TCLP) on these separated solids streams determined
   that this novel treatment diminished the risk of radium mobility for the
   reclaimed sand, clays or disposed material, rendering them better suited
   for landfilling.}},

Abstract = {{Packaging developers in the food industry must consider several,
   sometimes conflicting, environmental requirements on packaging along
   with an already complex combination of marketing, logistics and
   production requirements. Existing methods for the environmental
   evaluation of packaging either focus on a limited amount of
   environmental packaging criteria (such as recyclability or renewable
   content) or rely on life cycle assessment methodology requiring expert
   competence. To support the food industry in their efforts toward
   developing product and packaging combinations that reduce the total
   environmental impact in food supply chains, this article presents a
   simplified environmental evaluation tool for food packaging. The
   presented tool was developed through an iterative process in a
   collaborative research project with the food industry. It evaluates
   packaging systems based on packaging criteria sorted into four areas
   that represent the life-cycle steps packaging material production,
   transport, household and end-of-life. A comparison of the tool results
   and screening LCA results for three packaging cases showed no major
   differences. From the practitioners' perspective, the main advantages of
   the suggested tool are that it does not require LCA-competence, that the
   required input data is commonly available in packaging development
   projects and that its overall structure invites several functions of the
   company to participate. The theoretical benefits of the suggested tool
   are that it allows for a parallel assessment of eco-efficiency and
   eco-effectiveness criteria in a life cycle perspective and that it
   considers littering risk as well as the influence of packaging on food
   waste in households}},

Abstract = {{The recycling of packaging waste is an important part of the EU circular
   economy package, with a political focus on raising the recycling targets
   for post-consumer plastic packaging waste (PEW). The recycling of PPW
   involves at least three steps; collection, sorting and mechanical
   recycling. In contrast to the first two steps, mechanical recycling is
   poorly documented, as it is considered a free market activity. In order
   to provide a complete chain description the mechanical recycling yields
   were determined. The recovery of mass was determined for the main
   plastic sorting products from both major collection systems: separate
   collection (SC) and mechanical recovery (MR) from municipal solid waste.
   This technical assessment was conducted with a laboratory set-up for a
   standard mechanical recycling process. This analysis showed that there
   is a substantial sample-to-sample variation in polymeric composition
   between similar feedstocks and this variation is also observed in
   recovered masses. Next, the mechanical recycling of polyethylene
   feedstocks was studied more in depth. Six PE feedstocks with a gradual
   increasing level of complexity (from only transparent PE bottle bodies
   to the complete PE sorting product according to DKR 329), were prepared
   and mechanical recycled with the laboratory set-up. Since the polymeric
   composition of both the six feedstocks and the six floating milled goods
   were known, the net PE recycling yield could be calculated. The net PE
   yields are close to 100\% for such a standard recycling process.
   Additionally, the compositional analysis revealed that contaminants are
   only partially removed by the standard mechanical recycling process.}},

   for the introduction of samples into the inductively coupled plasma mass

   analysis of samples collected by a PILS after off-line filtration. This
   makes it possible to conduct multi-elemental analysis of the samples

Abstract = {{This study concerns the production of hydrogen and methane from a Food
   Residue Biomass (FORBI) product (Papanikola et al. in 5th international
   conference on sustainable waste management systems, Athens, 2017),
   generated from pre-sorted HFW in a CSTR and in a PABR respectively.
   FORBI is generated by drying and shredding the fermentable fraction of
   household food waste collected door-to-door in the Municipality of
   Halandri, Greece. Hydrogen production from FORBI through anaerobic
   fermentation under acidogenic mesophilic conditions was carried out
   using a 4 L CSTR, operated at 12 h HRT under an organic loading of 15 g
   TS L-1. The H-2-CSTR was operated for 40 days. During the operation of
   H-2-CSTR the production of biogas reached up to 0.1026 L-biogas
   g(FORBI)(-1) and the percentage of hydrogen in the gas up to 48.2\%. The
   conversion of FORBI into methane was carried out through the operation
   of a 77 L PABR operated under mesophilic methanogenic conditions at
   various operating parameters (OLR, HRT, T). Two different approaches
   were adopted for the pre-treatment of the feedstock. For the two first
   phases of the experimental procedure, a liquid extraction step was
   carried out before feeding the bioreactor with the separated liquid
   fraction, while in the subsequent three phases, a whole suspension of
   FORBI was used as feed. The mean biogas production rate was 0.158 +/-
   0.02 L-biogas g(FORBI)(-1) and the mean methane percentage in the biogas
   was 67.5 +/- 2.1\%, in the first two phases. The mean biogas production
   rate was 0.519 +/- 0.03 L-biogas g(FORBI)(-1) and the mean methane
   percentage in the biogas was 66 +/- 2.8\%, when a whole suspension of
   FORBI was fed to the PABR.}},
