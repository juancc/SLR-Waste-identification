Abstract = {{The paper contributes to the debate concerning the management of
   municipal solid waste by providing an analysis of two key aspects of
   waste management -namely, waste separation and dispatch to treatment
   plants. Our analysis aims at detecting the extent to which actual
   behavior in (close-by) municipalities is similar with respect to those
   two aspects. To pursue our scope, a complex network approach is
   followed. In particular, we conceptualize, explore and compare two
   networks, whose nodes are the municipalities, while weights synthesize
   in one network the percentage of sorted waste that is collected at a
   municipal level, and in the other one the distance from the waste
   processing plants used by each municipality. The theoretical network
   models are implemented through an empirical study based on a high
   quality dataset referred to Italian municipalities. In this regard, the
   detection of communities of municipalities and their geospatial
   contextualization are introduced as devices for a complete description
   of current practices of municipal waste separation and transfers in
   Italy.

Abstract = {{We present a proof-of-concept method to classify the presence of glass
   and metal in consumer trash bags. With the prevalent utilization of
   waste collection trucks in municipal solid waste management, the aim of
   this method is to help pinpoint the locations where waste sorting
   quality is below accepted standards, making it possible and more
   efficient to develop tailored procedures that can improve the waste
   sorting quality in areas with the most urgent needs. Using trash bags
   containing various amounts of glass and metal, in addition to common
   waste found in households, we use a combination of sound recording and a
   beat-frequency oscillation metal detector as inputs to a machine
   learning algorithm to identify the occurrence of glass and metal in
   trash bags. A custom-built test rig was developed to mimic a real waste
   collection truck, which was used to test different sensors and build the
   datasets. Convolutional neural networks were trained for the
   classification task, achieving accuracies of up to 98\%. These promising
   results support this method's potential implementation in real waste
   collection trucks, enabling location-specific and long-term monitoring
   of consumer waste sorting quality, which can provide decision support
   for waste management systems, and research on consumer behavior. (C)

Abstract = {{In order to exploit economies of scale Belgian municipalities regularly
   cooperate in the provision of waste related services. In particular for
   the collection and separation of household packaging waste,
   municipalities appear to seek technical and cost efficiency gains by
   cooperating via municipal waste joint ventures. Although most Belgian
   municipal waste joint ventures can present excellent recycling and
   recovery rates for household packaging waste, their performance in terms
   of cost-efficiency has never been assessed. Using a unique dataset
   comprising of the costs for all 35 Belgian municipal waste joint
   ventures in 2010, this paper present the first assessment of the cost
   efficiency of household packaging waste collection in Belgium. As we are
   not sure on the relative importance of the separate cost efficiency
   scores for the three selectively collected household packaging waste
   fractions when determining the overall cost efficiency, this paper draws
   on the Benefit-of-the-Doubt approach. Our results indicate that, despite

Abstract = {{Domestic waste classification was incorporated into legal provisions

   domestic waste is highly inefficient. To that end, in this article, we
   propose a multimodel cascaded convolutional neural network (MCCNN) for

   subnetworks (DSSD, YOLOv4, and Faster-RCNN) to obtain the detections.
   Moreover, to suppress the false-positive predicts, we utilized a
   classification model cascaded with the detection part to judge whether
   the detection results are correct. To train and evaluate MCCNN, we
   designed a large-scale waste image dataset (LSWID), containing 30 000
   domestic waste multilabeled images with 52 categories. To the best of
   our knowledge, the LSWID is the largest dataset on domestic waste
   images. Furthermore, a smart trash can is designed and applied to a

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the quantity and the type of residual household waste (RHW)
   generated by a population within a given territory is essential for
   developing affordable, effective, and sustainable management strategies
   for waste. This study aims to accurately describe the composition of
   residential residual materials collected directly from households over
   the course of a year. Household waste was collected from urban and rural
   sectors that were representative of the study territory. Samples were
   collected during the winter, summer, and fall of 2014. A total of 3039
   kg of RHW was collected and sorted into 9 categories and 39
   subcategories. Statistical analysis showed, except for organic matter,
   that the weight percentage of each category of material did not
   significantly differ among sampling periods or locations. Therefore, the
   results for a category were compiled to generate a single value to
   calculate the relative abundance of each type of residual material.
   Organic matter made up the majority fraction of the RHW (53\% to 66\%).
   This was followed by plastics (9\%), bulky items and
   renovation/demolition debris (6\%), textiles (5\%), metals (4\%), paper
   and cardboard fiber (4\%), glass (2\%), and household hazardous waste
   (2\%). This approach has allowed us to improve the accuracy of the data
   used in MRM, contribute to the creation of a regional dataset for waste,
   and develop a methodology more applicable to local realities. Specific
   to the immediate needs of municipal MRM, we updated knowledge regarding
   the generation, recovery, and disposal of the contents of the
   residential sector, and tracked the evolution and the variation of
   contents over a given period. We believe our methodology is applicable
   to other regions having similar characteristics in terms of climate,
   socio-economic status, and other parameters that affect the composition
   of RHW. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The accurate and effective classification of household solid waste (HSW)
   is an indispensable component in the current procedure of waste
   disposal. In this paper, a novel ensemble learning model called
   EnCNN-UPMWS, which is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
   an unequal precision measurement weighting strategy (UPMWS), is proposed
   for the classification of HSW via waste images. First, three
   state-of-the-art CNNs, namely GoogLeNet, ResNet-50, and MobileNetV2, are
   used as ingredient classifiers to separately predict and obtain three
   predicted probability vectors, which are significant elements that
   affect the prediction performance by providing complementary information
   about the patterns to be classified. Then, the UPMWS is introduced to
   determine the weight coefficients of the ensemble models. The actual
   one-hot encoding labels of the validation set and the predicted
   probability vectors from the CNN ensemble are creatively used to
   calculate the weights for each classifier during the training phase,
   which can bring the aggregated prediction vector closer to the target
   label and improve the performance of the ensemble model. The proposed
   model was applied to two datasets, namely TrashNet (an open-access
   dataset) and FourTrash, which was constructed by collecting a total of
   47,332 common HSW images containing four types of waste (wet waste,
   recyclables, harmful waste, and dry waste). The experimental results
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of its
   accuracy and F1-scores. Moreover, it was found that the UPMWS can simply
   and effectively enhance the performance of the ensemble learning model,
   and has potential applications in similar tasks of classification via
   ensemble learning.}},

Journal = {DATA},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The pioneering developed simplified mathematical model can be used to
   determine the energy consumption of the torrefaction process.
   Specifically, the energy balance model was developed for torrefaction of
   municipal solid waste (MSW; a combustible fraction of common municipal
   waste). Municipalities are adopting waste separation and need tools for
   energy recovery options. This type of model is needed for initial
   decision-making, evaluation of cost estimates, life cycle analysis
   (LCA), and for optimizing the torrefaction of MSW. The MSW inputs are
   inherently variable and are site-, location-, and country-dependent.
   Thus, in this model, MSW inputs consist of eight types of common
   municipal waste components: chicken meat, diapers, gauze, eggs
   packaging, paper receipts, cotton, genuine leather, and polypropylene.
   The model uses simple experimental input consisting of thermogravimetric
   (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses for each type
   of individual MSW material. The model was created in a Microsoft Office
   Excel spreadsheet and is available for download and use for

Title = {Modeling transfer station locations considering source separation of

Abstract = {{Lack of infrastructures, rapid growth in population, high urbanization
   and unsegregation makes the management of municipal solid waste a
   difficult task for local authorities. The paper proposes an approach for
   selecting the waste transfer station locations under unsegregated and
   segregated waste scenarios in an economical manner. The analytical
   approach is a combination of two basic components, (i) a mathematical
   optimization model for the overall cost of municipal solid waste
   management; and (ii) tools of a geographic information system for
   creating the dataset of the mathematical model. The novelty in the
   developed model includes strategic allocation of transfer stations for
   three scenarios: (i) solid waste collected from sources without
   segregation (Scenario (I)); (ii) waste collected considering source
   separation and transfer stations taking only one type of wastes
   (Scenario (II)); (iii) waste collected under source separation and
   transfer stations having multiple halls for multiple types of waste
   (Scenario (III)). The proposed approach has been verified by applying on
   city of Bilaspur, India. Optimization model selects six best locations
   for Scenario (I), (II) and five for Scenario (III). Results also show
   that among the three scenarios studied, scenario (III) is the best as it
   is providing more profit than scenario (II) and (I). Validity of the
   model is tested by ANOVA analysis and it suggested key parameters
   (frequency, operating cost and land value) as significant. This finding
   suggests that transfer stations with or without multiple halls under
   source separation environment can earn the profit from solid waste while
   solving the problem of high collection cost and landfills. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{This paper presents an extensive research carried out for enhancing the
   performances of convolutional neural network (CNN) object detectors
   applied to municipal waste identification. In order to obtain an
   accurate and fast CNN architecture, several types of Single Shot
   Detectors (SSD) and Regional Proposal Networks (RPN) have been
   fine-tuned on the TrashNet database. The network with the best
   performances is executed on one autonomous robot system, which is able
   to collect detected waste from the ground based on the CNN feedback. For
   this type of application, a precise identification of municipal waste
   objects is very important. In order to develop a straightforward
   pipeline for waste detection, the paper focuses on boosting the
   performance of pre-trained CNN Object Detectors, in terms of precision,
   generalization, and detection speed, using different loss optimization
   methods, database augmentation, and asynchronous threading at inference
   time. The pipeline consists of data augmentation at the training time
   followed by CNN feature extraction and box predictor modules for
   localization and classification at different feature map sizes. The
   trained model is generated for inference afterwards. The experiments
   revealed better performances than all other Object Detectors trained on
   TrashNet or other garbage datasets with a precision of 97.63\% accuracy
   for SSD and 95.76\% accuracy for Faster R-CNN, respectively. In order to
   find the optimal higher and lower bounds of our learning rate where the
   network is actually learning, we trained our model for several epochs,
   updating the learning rate after each epoch, starting from 1 x 10(-10)
   and decreasing it until reaching 1 x 10(-1).}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of RGBD-based detection and
   categorization of waste objects for nuclear decommissioning. To enable
   autonomous robotic manipulation for nuclear decommissioning, nuclear
   waste objects must he detected and categorized. However, as a novel
   industrial application, large amounts of annotated waste object data are
   currently unavailable. To overcome this problem, we propose a weakly
   supervised learning approach which is able to learn a deep convolutional
   neural network from unlabeled RGBD videos while requiring very few
   annotations. The proposed method also has the potential to be applied to
   other household or industrial applications. We evaluate our approach on
   the Washington RGB-D object recognition benchmark, achieving the
   state-of-theart performance among semi-supervised methods. More
   importantly, we introduce a novel dataset, i.e., Birmingham nuclear
   waste simulants dataset, and evaluate our proposed approach on this
   novel industrial object recognition challenge. We further propose a
   complete real-time pipeline for RGBD-based detection and categorization
   of nuclear waste simulants. Our weakly supervised approach has
   demonstrated to be highly effective in solving a novel RGB-D object

Title = {Statistical analysis for the quality assessment of digestates from
   separately collected organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW)
   and agro-industrial feedstock. Should input feedstock to anaerobic
   digestion determine the legal status of digestate?},
Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT},

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Management options for digestate produced by anaerobic digestion plants
   influence the environmental and economic sustainability of the biogas
   sector. Further, digestate can be both used or disposed of according to
   its legal classification: that is, waste or by-product, or product (by
   using End of Waste procedure). Currently, legal digestate status is
   decided by EU member states on a case-by-case basis, according to
   specific positive lists of input feedstocks and quality requirements in
   terms of physical properties and chemical concentrations. Biased
   exclusion of input feedstock can force digestate to a specific waste
   classification and undergo post-treatment and disposal options that can
   negatively affect the profitability of biogas installations. This is the
   case of the Italian regulation, where the positive list of input
   feedstock excludes a priori separately collected organic fractions of
   municipal solid waste (OFMSW), while including agro-industrial residues
   (AGRO). This study determined the differences between the two digestate
   typologies (OFMSW versus AGRO) through statistical analysis, implemented
   on a dataset, designed to gather data about digestate's
   physical-chemical parameters from relevant scientific literature and
   unpublished private databases. The datasets consisted of 190 entries,
   derived from more than 2,000 samples. Further, the study provided a
   compliance assessment between the resulting parameter means and the
   current regulation limits. Upper confidence limits for the means (level
   of significance alpha = 0.05) calculated for both digestate typologies
   were found to be compliant with the legal requirements. Therefore, no
   statistical ratio seems to support the difference in the legislative
   approach as proposed by Italian lawmakers. OFMSW resulted significantly
   different from AGRO for VS (650.1 g/kg TS vs. 843.8 g/kg TS,
   respectively), N-NH4 (81.9 g/kg TS vs. 46.19 g/kg TS), N-TOT (109.7 g/kg

   mg/kg TS vs. 4.66 mg/kg TS), Ni (11.03 mg/kg TS vs. 8.20 mg/kg TS),
   Cr-TOT (12.74 mg/kg TS vs. 8.74 mg/kg TS) and Hg (0.08 mg/kg TS vs. 0.05

Abstract = {{Knowledge of higher heating value (HHV) is critically important in the
   techno-economic analysis and optimal performance of thermal
   waste-to-energy (WTE) systems. In this work, we proposed a rapid and
   cost-effective method to accurately estimate the high heating value for
   various municipal solid wastes using a novel machine learning technique
   and the ultimate analysis. To this end, we relied on a comprehensive
   experimental HHV dataset from a diverse range of geographical origins
   and eight various waste classifications (i.e., 30 paper, 12 textile, 12
   rubber and leather, 29 MSW mixture, 34 plastic, 61 wood, 20 sewage
   sludge, and 53 other wastes). In particular, we developed nonlinear HHV
   equations for fast, accurate, straightforward applications (e.g.,
   especially when limited elemental information is available) using robust
   gene expression programming (GEP) algorithm. Meanwhile, we analyzed the
   accuracy gains from the application of more complex and nonlinear models
   such as a novel support vector machine (RBAS-SVM) and a feed-forward
   neural network (FFNN). While coefficient of determination (R-2) of the
   time-saving and straightforward GEP equations is 0.966, the SVM and FFNN
   models have 0.973 and 0.978 R-2. Besides, root mean square error (RMSE)
   of GEP, SVM, and FFNN models are 1.57, 1.44, and 1.25, respectively. The
   results of statistical performances for the entire dataset showed that
   average absolute error (AAE) of the proposed models in a range of

Title = {Solid Waste Analysis Using Open-Access Socio-Economic Data},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {{2022}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays, problems related with solid waste management become a
   challenge for most countries due to the rising generation of waste,
   related environmental issues, and associated costs of produced wastes.
   Effective waste management systems at different geographic levels
   require accurate forecasting of future waste generation. In this work,
   we investigate how open-access data, such as provided from the
   Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), can be
   used for the analysis of waste data. The main idea of this study is
   finding the links between socio-economic and demographic variables that
   determine the amounts of types of solid wastes produced by countries.
   This would make it possible to accurately predict at the country level
   the waste production and determine the requirements for the development
   of effective waste management strategies. In particular, we use several
   machine learning data regression (Support Vector, Gradient Boosting, and
   Random Forest) and clustering models (k-means) to respectively predict
   waste production for OECD countries along years and also to perform
   clustering among these countries according to similar characteristics.
   The main contributions of our work are: (1) waste analysis at the OECD
   country-level to compare and cluster countries according to similar
   waste features predicted; (2) the detection of most relevant features
   for prediction models; and (3) the comparison between several regression
   models with respect to accuracy in predictions. Coefficient of
   determination (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error
   (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), respectively, are
   used as indices of the efficiency of the developed models. Our
   experiments have shown that some data pre-processings on the OECD data
   are an essential stage required in the analysis; that Random Forest
   Regressor (RFR) produced the best prediction results over the dataset;
   and that these results are highly influenced by the quality of available
   socio-economic data. In particular, the RFR model exhibited the highest
   accuracy in predictions for most waste types. For example, for
   ``municipal `` waste, it produced, respectively, R-2 = 1 and MAPE=4.31
   global error values for the test set; and for ``household `` waste, it,
   respectively, produced R-2 = 1 and MAPE=3.03. Our results indicate that
   the considered models (and specially RFR) all are effective in
   predicting the amount of produced wastes derived from input data for the
   considered countries.}},

Abstract = {{Ongoing urbanization leads to steady growth of urban areas. In the case
   of highly dynamic change of municipalities, due to the rates of change,
   responsible administrations often are challenged or struggle with
   capturing present states of urban sites or accurately planning future
   urban development. An interest for urban planning lies on socio-economic
   conditions, as consumption and production of disposable goods are
   related to economic possibilities. Therefore, we developed an approach
   to generate relevant parameters for infrastructure planning by means of
   remote sensing and spatial analysis. In this study, the single building
   defines the spatial unit for the parameters. In the case city Belmopan
   (Belize), based on WorldView-1 data we manually define a city covering
   building dataset. Residential buildings are classified to eight building
   types which are locally adapted to Belmopan. A random forest (RF)
   classifier is trained with locally collected training data. Through
   household interviews focusing on household assets, income and
   educational level, a socio-economic point (SEP) scaling is defined,
   which correlates very well with the defined building typology. In order
   to assign socio-economic parameters to the single building, five
   socio-economic classes (SEC) are established based on SEP statistics for
   the building types. The RF building type classification resulted in high
   accuracies. Focusing on the three categories to describe residential
   socio-economic states allowed high correlations between the defined
   building and socio-economic points. Based on the SEP we projected a
   citywide residential socio-economic building classification to support
   supply and disposal infrastructure planning.}},

   that are not geared toward energy recovery. A database consisting of
   methane (CH4) generation data, the major constituent of biogas, from 49
   laboratory experiments and field monitoring data from 57 landfills was
   developed. Three CH4 generation parameters, i.e., waste decay rate (k),
   CH4 generation potential (L-0), and time until maximum CH4 generation
   rate (t(max)), were calculated for each dataset using U.S. EPA's
   Landfill Gas Emission Model (LandGEM). Factors influencing the derived
   parameters in laboratory experiments and landfills were investigated
   using multi-linear regression analysis. Total weight of waste (W) was
   correlated with biodegradation conditions through a ranked
   classification scheme. k increased with increasing percentage of readily
   biodegradable waste (B-r0 (\%)) and waste temperature, and reduced with
   increasing W, an indicator of less favorable biodegradation conditions.
   The values of k obtained in the laboratory were commonly significantly
   higher than those in landfills and those recommended by LandGEM. The
   mean value of L-0 was 98 and 88 L CH4/kg waste for laboratory and field
   studies, respectively, but was significantly affected by waste
   composition with ranges from 10 to 300 L CH4/kg. t(max) increased with
   increasing percentage of biodegradable waste (B-0) and W. The values of
   t(max) in landfills were higher than those in laboratory experiments or
   those based on LandGEM's recommended parameters. Enhancing
   biodegradation conditions in landfill cells has a greater impact on
   improving k and t(max) than increasing B-0. Optimizing the B-0 and B-r0
   values of landfilled waste increases L-0 and reduces t(max). (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In the last decade, extended efforts have been poured into energy
   efficiency. Several energy consumption datasets were henceforth
   published, with each dataset varying in properties, uses and
   limitations. For instance, building energy consumption patterns are
   sourced from several sources, including ambient conditions, user
   occupancy, weather conditions and consumer preferences. Thus, a proper
   understanding of the available datasets will result in a strong basis
   for improving energy efficiency. Starting from the necessity of a
   comprehensive review of existing databases, this work is proposed to
   survey, study and visualize the numerical and methodological nature of
   building energy consumption datasets. A total of thirty-one databases
   are examined and compared in terms of several features, such as the
   geographical location, period of collection, number of monitored
   households, sampling rate of collected data, number of sub-metered
   appliances, extracted features and release date. Furthermore, data
   collection platforms and related modules for data transmission, data
   storage and privacy concerns used in different datasets are also
   analyzed and compared. Based on the analytical study, a novel dataset
   has been presented, namely Qatar university dataset, which is an
   annotated power consumption anomaly detection dataset. The latter will
   be very useful for testing and training anomaly detection algorithms,
   and hence reducing wasted energy. Moving forward, a set of
   recommendations is derived to improve datasets collection, such as the
   adoption of multi-modal data collection, smart Internet of things data
   collection, low-cost hardware platforms and privacy and security
   mechanisms. In addition, future directions to improve datasets
   exploitation and utilization are identified, including the use of novel
   machine learning solutions, innovative visualization tools and
   explainable mobile recommender systems. Accordingly, a novel
   visualization strategy based on using power consumption micro-moments
   has been presented along with an example of deploying machine learning
   algorithms to classify the micro-moment classes and identify anomalous
   power usage. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) becomes the most popular
   technique to enhance environment protection. This process produces one
   of the most toxic chemicals in the world, i.e., polychlorinated
   dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). The
   dioxin (DXN) production should be restricted rigidly by using operation
   optimization and control of MSWI process based on present industrial
   devices. However, it is difficult to realize the on-line real-time
   continuous measuring of DXN duo to the complexity formation mechanism
   and high-cost long-time off-line detection approach. In this paper, a
   soft measuring method based on virtual sample generation (VSG) is used
   to address this problem at the first time. A few numbers of true
   training samples are used to produce virtual training samples based on
   feasibility-based programming (FBP) model using selective ensemble
   kernel partial least squares (SENKPLS) and prior knowledge. Simulation
   result based on dataset in reference {[}31] for a HL MSWI process shows
   effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Compared to Intrusive Load Monitoring which uses smart power meters at
   each level to be monitored, Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is an
   ingenious way that relies on signal readings at a single point to deduce
   the share of the devices that have contributed to the overall load. This
   reliable technique that guarantees the safety and privacy of individual
   users has recently become an increasingly popular topic, as it turns out
   to be a major solution to assist household users in the process of
   obtaining details of their electricity consumption. The detailed
   consumption promotes better management of the electrical power on the
   consumer side by helping to eliminate any waste of energy. In this
   paper, an edge gateway has been implemented to safely monitor the
   overall load in a smart energy system. A load separation method has been
   introduced based on events detected on a low-frequency power signal,
   which allows the consumption profile of On/Off and multi-state devices
   to be generated without relying on the knowledge of the cardinality of
   these devices Following the extraction of significant features contained
   in the aggregate signal, an appliance profile recognition approach is
   presented based on the non-parametric Mean Shift algorithm. The ability
   of the proposed method to learn and deduce devices profile is validated
   using the Reference Energy Disaggregation Dataset (REDD). The
   experimental results show that the proposed approach is efficient in
   detecting events of binary state and finite state appliances.}},

Abstract = {{Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) is an indicator of organic pollution in
   freshwater bodies correlated to microbiological contamination. High BOD
   concentrations reduce oxygen availability, degrade aquatic habitats and
   biodiversity, and impair water use. High BOD loadings to freshwater
   systems are mainly coming from anthropogenic sources, comprising
   domestic and livestock waste, industrial emissions, and combined sewer
   overflows. We developed a conceptual model (GREEN(BoD)(+)) to assess
   mean annual current organic pollution (BOD fluxes) across Europe. The
   model was informed with the latest available European datasets of
   domestic and industrial emissions, population and livestock densities.
   Model parameters were calibrated using 2008-2012 mean annual BOD
   concentrations measured in 2157 European monitoring stations, and
   validated with other 1134 stations. The most sensitive model parameters
   were abatement of BOD by secondary treatment and the BOD decay exponent
   of travel time. The mean BOD concentrations measured in monitored
   stations was 2.10 mg O-2/L and predicted concentrations were 2.54 mg
   O-2/L; the 90th percentile of monitored BOD concentration was 3.51 mg
   O-2/L while the predicted one was 4.76 mg O-2/L. The model could
   correctly classify reaches for BOD concentrations classes, from high to
   poor quality, in 69\% of cases. High overestimations (incorrect
   classification by 2 or more classes) were 2\% and large underestimations
   were 5\% of cases. Across Europe about 12\% of freshwater network was
   estimated to be failing good quality due to excessive BOD concentrations
   (>5 mg O-2/L). Dominant sources of BOD to freshwaters and seas were
   point sources and emissions from intensive livestock systems. Comparison
   with previous assessments confirms a decline of BOD pollution since the
   introduction of EU legislation regulating water pollution. (C) 2019 The
