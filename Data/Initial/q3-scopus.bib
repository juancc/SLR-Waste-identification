abstract={Accurate and efficient treatment of domestic waste is an important part of urban management. Whether domestic waste can be classified effectively will affect the sustainable development of human society. Previous research on the problem of waste image classification has focused on single-category waste recognition, which falls short of meeting the needs of real waste classification scenarios. In this study, a YOLO-WASTE multi-label waste classification model based on transfer learning is constructed to realize the fast recognition and classification of multiple wastes. To speed up and optimize the learning efficiency of the model, a multi-label waste image dataset is also created, with each image including multiple wastes or multiple categories of waste. The experimental result shows that the mAP value of the YOLO-WASTE model is 92.23%, and the average time of detecting an image is 0.424 s, its classification performance is significantly better than other image classification algorithms. The proposed YOLO-WASTE model provides new insights into complex waste identification and has the potential to help advance efficient waste management for sustainable urban development. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Waste sorting is highly labor intensive because the wide variety of waste items prohibits automation. More recently, deep learning (DL) and computer vision technology has presented an opportunity to streamline the sorting process, but many important developmental steps remain. If computer vision technology can increase the efficiency of automated waste sorting, this would be beneficial for society and the environment. Accordingly, this study used the You Only Look Once-v3 (Yolo-v3) detection model based on DL to enhance recognition performance of household waste products. TrashNet, a commonly used waste image database, was used to train an initial Yolo-v3 model, however each image used for training only had a single waste object, and this study found that the detection model trained with a single object dataset was not only unsuitable for sorting multiple waste objects, but that this has rarely been addressed in academic literature. It was also discovered that nations and regions will need to develop their own unique databases that reflect the types of waste products found. Samples images need to account for the various appearances and colors and be combined in multiple waste object images when training the system. This paper documents the training and testing of an object detection model suitable for detecting domestic waste specific to Taiwan; however, the approach taken would be of use to other countries seeking to automate waste sorting. To achieve this, it was necessary to compile the Taiwan Recycled Waste Database (TRWD). This was then used to train the Yolo-v3, and the efficiencies of this, versus the standard TrashNet model were compared. Results showed that the TRWD-trained Yolo-v3 achieved mAP@0.5 of 92.12% and could detect waste in real-time. Relative to the TrashNet-trained Yolo-v3, the TRWD counterpart performed better due to the multiple waste objects and more relevant image repository. Further studies are recommended to investigate the effect of combining additional sensors that would enable improved detection of specific wastes. Combining the TRWD-trained Yolo-v3 with a robot system for waste sorting would potentially be another rewarding avenue of research. © 2022},

abstract={Garbage classification technology is not only an important basis for the harmless treatment of waste and resource recovery, but also the inevitable trend of social development. The current garbage classification methods rely on manual classification in the garbage collection stage, and it is difficult to achieve satisfying results in consistency, stability, and sanitary conditions. For this reason, this study designs and develops a garbage classification system based on deep learning that can recognize and recycle domestic garbage. Focusing on the problems of low accuracy and poor real-time performance, a lightweight garbage classification model GCNet (Garbage Classification Network) is proposed. GCNet contains three improvements on ShuffleNet v2, including the design of parallel mixed attention mechanism (PMAM), the use of new activation functions, and transfer learning. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of GCNet on the self-built dataset is 97.9%, the amount of model parameters is only 1.3M, the single inference time on Raspberry Pi 4B is about 105ms, and the classification system needs only 0.88 seconds to complete the classification and collection of a single object. The method proposed in this paper is an effective attempt at machine vision in garbage classification and resource recovery. With the improvement of technology, it will effectively promote academic exploration and engineering application in the field of resources and environment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Expanding the curbside collection system for household plastic packaging could help in accomplishing the ambitious recycling targets set by the European Union. In this study, the effects of such expansion in terms of quality and quantity of sorted plastic waste fractions were investigated. By applying a validated sorting model, the flows of packages in Belgium from their use phase until the output of the sorting plant and the quantity and composition of sorted waste fractions were simulated. These data were subsequently used to calculate existing performance indicators, such as grade and recovery, as well as new indicators, such as the Simpson's Diversity Index (SDI), which is a measure for the compositional diversity of sorted waste fractions. The highest SDI was calculated for the fraction named ‘other films’, namely 82%, showing that this fraction comprised the most diverse polymer mixture. Results indicated that certain sorted fractions achieve high product grade levels, e.g. more than 99% for the PS rigid fraction, whereas others had significantly lower product grades of approximately 80% for the PE films. Material Flow Analysis showed that by expanding the collection portfolio the collection rate of plastic packaging increased from 33.6 to 64.4 m%, of which 77.3% is simulated to be separated in the targeted waste fractions. However, this will be insufficient to meet the recycling target of 50% by 2025 as in total only 49.8% of plastic packaging is sorted correctly. Hence, additional improvements in both recycling technologies and packaging design are needed to further increase plastic recycling rates. © 2021 The Author(s)},

abstract={Automated waste sorting can dramatically increase waste sorting efficiency and reduce its regulation cost. Most of the current methods only use a single modality such as image data or acoustic data for waste classification, which makes it difficult to classify mixed and confusable wastes. In these complex situations, using multiple modalities becomes necessary to achieve a high classification accuracy. Traditionally, the fusion of multiple modalities has been limited by fixed handcrafted features. In this study, the deep-learning approach was applied to the multimodal fusion at the feature level for municipal solid-waste sorting. More specifically, the pre-trained VGG16 and one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNNs) were utilized to extract features from visual data and acoustic data, respectively. These deeply learned features were then fused in the fully connected layers for classification. The results of comparative experiments proved that the proposed method was superior to the single-modality methods. Additionally, the feature-based fusion strategy performed better than the decision-based strategy with deeply learned features. © 2022, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Technological interventions and eco-innovative solutions are necessary to cope with the adverse environmental impacts of waste accumulation. The notion to consider “waste as a resource and recycling of the same for getting the value of the waste” has truly transformed the approach towards solid waste management (SWM). Technological eco-innovations rely on the automation of waste segregation, collection, route optimization, digital apps for creating communication (enhanced efficiency by 40–85%) and treatment technologies. The regulatory framework with amendments in rules, new policies, schemes, smart city missions are responsible for the implementation of “Tech-innovations” at the ground level and has shown societal benefits. India has significantly shown progress in sustainable development goals (SDGs) score from 50.93 to 60.23 (year 2000–2019). The innovative and sustainable waste management practices in India have increased contribution to renewable energy (approx. 2554 MW/annum), 15-billion-USD business opportunity by the circular economy, 25–30% resale profit from processed E-waste, increased co-operative collaborations, trailblazing start-ups, improved SDG 3,7,8,9,11,12,13, improved market for green products and services, brilliant institutional and regional innovations addressing the issue of climate change. The present article critically reviews the exemplary eco-innovations (technological and non-technological) including resource recovery and viable technologies for SWM in India. The review also illustrates the lacunae (in awareness, bioproducts adoption and advanced technologies), recommendations based on findings and future research areas. The paper can also assist researchers, entrepreneurs and the policy makers for improving the status of SWM in India as well as other developing countries with the same societal and economic status. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The influence of Covid-19 is reshaping our daily life. Along with protecting lives, management of contaminated covid wastes is very essential to reduce environmental and human health risks. Inappropriate management of covid wastes can cause serious possibilities of disease transmission to health workers, waste pickers, patients, and the community in general through spreading of Corona virus. Poor management of these infected wastes has created huge problems in healthcare waste handling as the amount of waste generated due to pandemic is excessively large. In this paper, we have presented an Internet of Things(IoT)-based smart framework for covid waste management. We have proposed two types of smart covid waste bins here, one for collecting covid wastes for home isolated patients and other for covid medical wastes, generated from hospitals/nursing homes, etc. These intelligent bins can capture waste information automatically by attached sensors, and the collected data is sent wirelessly to remote municipality server for further analysis. Municipality officials can take decisions such as number of bins to be deployed, at which time intervals wastes are to be cleared, etc., based on those information. The proposed framework minimizes the human interaction with the covid waste and restricts the spreading of virus. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The Chinese government is promoting a waste classification policy to solve the increasingly serious issue of cities being besieged by waste. Only few studies investigate whether residents’ understanding of garbage classification policy has an impact on their garbage classification behaviour and the nature of such impact. The purposes of this study are twofold: first, to explore conceptually the mechanism behind any moderating effects of perceived policy effectiveness (PPE) on waste classification and, second, to examine empirically if and how PPE influences the relationships between attitude (ATT), subjective norm (SN), perceived behaviour control (PBC), awareness of consequence (AC) and waste classification intention (WCI). The conceptual model of the study is developed by combining insights from the theory of planned behaviour, norm activation theory and value–belief–norm theory. A total of 351 questionnaires were administered in person to households in Bengbu, China. The results based on structural equation modelling with partial least squares show that PPE negatively moderates the relationship between AC and WCI. AC is more strongly related with the intention to classify waste when PPE is weaker. Likewise, when PPE is higher, people’s awareness of consequences becomes less important for WCI. The findings have significant implications in policymakersʹ developing guidelines and offer a framework for implementing more effective waste classification policy. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={The Smart City concept revolves around gathering real time data from citizen, personal vehicle, public transports, building, and other urban infrastructures like power grid and waste disposal system. The understandings obtained from the data can assist municipal authorities handle assets and services effectually. At the same time, the massive increase in environmental pollution and degradation leads to ecological imbalance is a hot research topic. Besides, the progressive development of smart cities over the globe requires the design of intelligent waste management systems to properly categorize the waste depending upon the nature of biodegradability. Few of the commonly available wastes are paper, paper boxes, food, glass, etc. In order to classify the waste objects, computer vision based solutions are cost effective to separate out the waste from the huge dump of garbage and trash. Due to the recent developments of deep learning (DL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL), waste object classification becomes possible by the identification and detection of wastes. In this aspect, this paper designs an intelligence DRL based recycling waste object detection and classification (IDRL-RWODC) model for smart cities. The goal of the IDRL-RWODC technique is to detect and classify waste objects using the DL and DRL techniques. The IDRL-RWODC technique encompasses a two-stage process namely Mask Regional Convolutional Neural Network (Mask RCNN) based object detection and DRL based object classification. In addition, DenseNet model is applied as a baseline model for the Mask RCNN model, and a deep Q-learning network (DQLN) is employed as a classifier.Moreover, a dragonfly algorithm (DFA) based hyperparameter optimizer is derived for improving the efficiency of the DenseNet model. In order to ensure the enhanced waste classification performance of the IDRL-RWODC technique, a series of simulations take place on benchmark dataset and the experimental results pointed out the better performance over the recent techniques with maximal accuracy of 0.993. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Since the detection of active pharmaceutical waste in the landfill soils and waters, several policy changes have been implemented. Most of the pharmaceutical waste is gathered from households, thus probably a new recycling policy should be implemented. This paper aims to prevent the pharmaceutical waste from getting into the soil by sorting any incoming pills in different categories so these can be disposed of properly without the risk of contaminants getting in the environment. The pills sorting system uses a machine vision based system. Pills are put on a conveyor belt which transports them through the sorting area. Pills images are analyzed and consequently they will be placed into different bins with the help of multiple palettes driven by stepper motors. This method ensures an efficient solution that could be implemented in any landfill sorting station. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

In addition, the problem of data uncertainty and the need to use expert judgements indicate the need for the implementation of methods adjusted to the qualitative and quantitative assessment, such as the fuzzy approach. Following this, in order to overcome the presented limitations, the authors introduced the new assessment method for waste sorting systems based on multi-criteria model implementation and fuzzy theory use. Therefore, the developed model was based on a hierarchical fuzzy logic model for which appropriate membership function parameters and inference rules were defined. The specificity of the chosen assessment criteria and their justification was provided. The model has been implemented to evaluate one of the waste sorting plants in Wroclaw, Poland. Tests have been conducted for seven different configurations of waste sorting lines (with variable input parameters). The study focuses on analysing the amount of selected waste at each station in relation to the total stream size of each fraction. Efficiency was measured by the mass of the collected waste and the number of pieces of waste in each fraction. Based on the obtained results, estimations of particular parameters of the model were made, and the results were presented and commented on. It was shown that there is a significant relationship between the level of system evaluation and sorting efficiency and an inverse relationship with the level of RDF obtained. The analysis was based on Pearson’s linear correlation coefficient estimation and linear regression implementation. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Only 4% of household waste generated in Africa is recycled. Current research uses machine learning models in cloud-based solutions to classify waste. However, in countries with limited internet access, there is a need to increase user engagement in classifying waste using an on-device approach. Developing a machine learning model for a mobile device with limited size and speed is a challenge. This research proposes an on-device deep learning framework to encourage the recycling of household waste. The proposed framework combines an optimal deep learning image classification model and gamification elements. A combination of multiple waste datasets named WasteNet consisting of 33,520 images is used to train the deep learning image classification model using seven classes of recyclable waste namely e-waste, garbage, glass, metal, organic, paper and plastic. Data augmentation and transfer learning techniques are applied to train five models on a mobile device namely, MobileNetV2, VGG19, DenseNet201, ResNet152V2 and InceptionResNetV2. Results of the five models are presented in this paper based on accuracy, loss, latency and size. This research shows promise for InceptionResNetV2, MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201in encouraging householders to engage in recycling waste using gamification on a mobile device. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Domestic waste classification was incorporated into legal provisions recently in China. However, relying on manpower to detect and classify domestic waste is highly inefficient. To that end, in this article, we propose a multimodel cascaded convolutional neural network (MCCNN) for domestic waste image detection and classification. MCCNN combined three subnetworks (DSSD, YOLOv4, and Faster-RCNN) to obtain the detections. Moreover, to suppress the false-positive predicts, we utilized a classification model cascaded with the detection part to judge whether the detection results are correct. To train and evaluate MCCNN, we designed a large-scale waste image dataset (LSWID), containing 30 000 domestic waste multilabeled images with 52 categories. To the best of our knowledge, the LSWID is the largest dataset on domestic waste images. Furthermore, a smart trash can is designed and applied to a Shanghai community, which helped to make waste recycling more efficient. Experimental results showed a state-of-the-art performance, with an average improvement of 10% in detection precision. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={With the deepening of the garbage classification policy strength, making urban household garbage sorting mandatory in China, it is imperative to clarify the key factors affecting the urban residents’ intention to behave in garbage classification. Though it has attracted the attention of researchers, there are still several aspects that need to be supplemented and improved. Thus, this study aims to investigate the critical factors affecting the urban residents’ intention of garbage sorting and develop an extended model of planned behavior by integrating expectancy theory (ET) and norm activation model (NAM). Given the positive externalities of urban residents’ garbage sorting behaviors, awareness of consequences and attribution of responsibility are correspondingly interpreted as environmental benefits (EB) and environmental concerns (EC). The sample data of 668 urban residents who lived in four pilot cities of garbage classification in China were collected and adopted to the structural equation modeling (SEM) with bootstrapping estimation method to assess the causal relationship between variables. The results indicated that the expectation (Exp) was a significant positive predictor of garbage sorting intention. Attitude (AT), perceived behavior control (PBC) and subjective norm (SN) positively affected urban residents’ expectation of garbage sorting, with SN having the most significant direct impact. The results also found that the EB has significant influences EC, which strongly influences urban residents’ expectation of garbage sorting. Furthermore, the total effect of EC on Exp is higher than other paths, and the mediating effect of SN on Exp by AT and PBC is greater than other indirect paths, which accounted for about 27.1% of the total effect. Finally, we discuss both theoretical and practical implications, along with recommendations for future research. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The results show that the current waste classification facility system in S city is basically completed; high rates of both properties and residents comply with the waste classification system. S city has established a government-led waste classification pattern that depends on social participation. This pattern has been recognized and accepted by residents and is economically sustainable. At the same time, it is pointed out that the current marginal effectiveness of the waste classification input is showing a declining trend. Future investment should shift from investment in facilities and equipment to incentives for autonomous management by residents, and the corresponding evaluation of investment and effectiveness should also change accordingly.

abstract={Municipal solid waste is associated with different systemic challenges, such as climate change, resource scarcity, and ocean plastic pollution. European countries are striving towards more circular material use and the European Commission has advocated the use of economic incentives to boost recycling. The pay-as-you-throw (PAYT) scheme is an economic instrument that applies the ‘polluter pays’ principle by charging for waste according to the actual amount of generated waste. Volume-based PAYT fees have shown to be potentially less effective in waste prevention and recycling than weight-based fees. This paper illustrates how waste management operators can price residual waste with weight-based fees that encourage recycling, are fair with respect to service levels, and cover the current income for municipal waste operators. The result, obtained by forming equations satisfying the above conditions, is a model with a linear, discrete price function, where the price of the residual waste generated by the citizen is a function of the service level. This model encourages efficient source separation through internal subsidies, wherein a citizen can decrease the price of household waste by 32% if they increase the sorting efficiency from a default of 40% to 80% efficiency. The application of the model was illustrated in a case example. The model developed in this study can be used to implement weight-based PAYT schemes locally, thereby supporting the formulation of waste management systems that facilitate waste reduction and recycling. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={The rapid economic and social development has led to a rapid increase in the output of domestic waste. How to realize waste classification through intelligent methods has become a key factor for human beings to achieve sustainable development. Traditional waste classification technology has low efficiency and low accuracy. To improve the efficiency and accuracy of waste classification processing, this paper proposes a DenseNet169 waste image classification model based on transfer learning. Because of the disadvantages of the existing public waste dataset, such as uneven distribution of data, single background, obvious features, and small sample size of the waste image, the waste image dataset NWNU-TRASH is constructed. The dataset has the advantages of balanced distribution, high diversity, and rich background, which is more in line with real needs. 70% of the dataset is used as the training set and 30% as the test set. Based on the deep learning network DenseNet169 pre-trained model, we can form a DenseNet169 model suitable for this experimental dataset. The experimental results show that the accuracy of classification is over 82% in the DenseNet169 model after the transfer learning, which is better than other image classification algorithms. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Seeing that Shanghai implemented mandatory household waste sorting system (referred as Shanghai Model) in 2019 and achieved remarkable improvements, the study focuses on how to localize it in second-tier cities. Specifically, by applying system dynamics method, a qualitative Basic Model and a quantitative Shanghai Model simulating residents’ waste related behavior are built. Combined Theory of Planned Behavior and the Split-Core Model are adopted. Data of Zhengzhou is inputted and simulated to representatively deliver policy implications to second-tier cities. The result shows that improving transactional context can lift the weight of willingness and depress the weight of opportunism in behavior decision makings. Shanghai Model significantly improves the legal transaction context of waste sorting which make residents actively sort the wastes under the promotion of willingness. For second-tier cities of China, improving transactional context to reduce opportunism and conquering the short board of willingness to promote active participation are indispensable. And, waste reducing measures like the unit pricing system are recommended to make up the shortage of the Shanghai Model. The study puts forward a synthetic analyzing framework of waste related behaviors and builds a portable policy analyzing system of waste management for both China and other developing countries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The global plastic consumption is consistently increasing, and plastic recycling is still a crucial issue to be solved due to the depletion of fossil resources. The polymers in the plastic can be chemically enhanced with materials such as colourants or metal fillers. This work aims to analyse the metal contamination data in the virgin plastic and plastic waste to derive a general categorisation rule for different plastic polymers (PET, PE, PP, PS). The metals contamination in plastics can be accumulated during use or waste management practices during recycling, which can be harmful for application. The metal concentrations for plastic streams are sampled from different origins: virgin plastic, household waste, and reprocessed household and industrial waste. Machine Learning methods, specifically the tree-based classification models, are used to derive a series of 'if-then' rules for classifying the plastic waste based on the sampled data. This helps the identification of the data patterns on the plastic streams and aids in deriving a categorisation rule for any plastic. The data-driven plastic categorisation could help in understanding the current waste practices and determining a proper recycling plan for local or even global plastic waste. © 2021 University of Split, FESB.},

abstract={The municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal system is the key for building the smart city. In the MSW disposal system, the MSW is allocated among the disposal plants in the first echelon, and then the derivatives (incineration residues and RDF) are allocated between residues disposal plants and markets in the second echelon. In the two-echelon optimal allocation of MSW disposal system, two objectives, cost and environmental impact, should be considered. Considering the uncertainty in the MSW disposal system, this paper constructs a grey fuzzy multi-objective two-echelon MSW allocation model. The model is divided into two sub models and the expected value sorting method is applied to solve the model. The proposed model successfully was applied to a real case in Huangshi, China. The numerical experiments showed RDF technology has advantages on both cost and environmental impact comparing to other disposal technology on disposing MSW. © 2021, ComSIS Consortium.

abstract={In Peru, solid waste accumulation has been constant for decades and impacts 72% of local governments, affecting 42% of the population. These numbers show new tools are required to better understand this phenomenon and develop appropriate mitigation methods. In this light, this research proposes an exploratory analysis of the study population against the accumulation of solid waste. For this, the study proposes the segmentation of a specific population through a set of social indicators grouped into three categories of analysis (i.e., sociocultural, sociodemographic, and socioeconomic) and, in turn, assess the geographic proximity between each group of people segmented according to the parameters used for this study, and the informal points of accumulation of MSW. To segment the study population, an unsupervised classification model (i.e., K-means) was used. For methodological purposes, the Puente Piedra district was chosen as a case study. The results show that the predominant population is framed between the ages of 36 to 45, with an intermediate educational level (i.e., secondary school) and an approximate monthly income of $ 300. In addition, the predominant family structure includes up to four members living in the same household. Finally, it is observed that the behavior of people who live close as neighbors is similar and is also related to the geographic location of the dumps. © 2021 WITPress. All rights reserved.},

Nowadays, the selection of processes configuration of WWTPs mainly depends on the local wastewater treatment standards and the experience of wastewater engineers rather than an intelligent data-driven strategy. In this study, an integrated data-driven strategy consisting of t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and deep neural networks (DNNs) is proposed for optimizing the processes configuration of full-scale WWTP predesign. A large dataset with 14,647 samples collected from 10 full-scale WWTPs with distinct treatment processes is clustered by the t-SNE method based on the influent characteristics, and four meaningful clusters (Clusters I–IV) are identified for the subsequent development of DNN classification models. All four DNN models achieve acceptable classification accuracy (>0.8975) and the maximal testing accuracy is 0.9505. The DNN models are capable of finding the optimized processes configuration of WWTPs under target scenarios. Our results highlight the strength of combining the t-SNE and the DNN models to utilize the relationships between key parameters and processes configuration of WWTPs, and help engineers predesign WWTPs with the optimal processes configuration. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Worldwide use of electronic devices has led to a serious socio-economic-technical challenge for managing them at their end-of-life stage. Managing EOL electronic devices or e-waste using traditional methods has been potentially hazardous to the environment and health. United nation' sustainable development goals also have linked e-waste to three of its SDGs and support the sustainable consumption and quantification of e-waste. Policy interventions, consumer awareness, and active environmentalist roles have forced developed nations to engage in scientific ways of e-waste treatment. The high cost of treatment and increasing volume has led to a scenario where developing nations, including India, have been more attractive and easy targets for dumping e-waste. Out of 1.7 million tons of e-waste generated in India, 8% of e-waste reaches the landfill as useless material, 1.5% of which are formal recycling, and the informal sector handles more than 90%. Ineffective policy implementation and lack of stakeholder participation pose a challenge in improving the scenario of e-waste management. Although, there is many stakeholders have been brought into the sphere of policy, household shave not been considered major generators, with about 16% of the total e-waste. Growing urbanization increased dependency on electronic product usage due to the pandemic; we need to channel the household e-waste to the formal treatment units with a systematic approach. Pune is one of the proposed smart cities and has been in the news due to the solid waste treatment challenges due to the treatment sites and infrastructure. With municipal solid waste, e-waste collection and treatment at the regular treatment facilities, not equipped to handle e-waste leads to untreated e-waste parts in whole or in traces. Lack of awareness and non-segregation at source, inadequate collection channels has impacted the environment, requiring a focused and workable systematic framework for household generated e-waste disposal. Access to disposal at the doorstep develops an integral behavior that can be altered by providing proper doorstep MSW disposal infrastructure as an extension of the existing municipal solid waste segregation model. This paper proposes a theoretical, sustainable, and integrated model built with the current MSW model foundation aimed at household e-waste management, providing collection and inventory services for Pune residents. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Because of the constantly increasing population of the Earth and the modern-day life, the municipal waste creation rate constantly grows. Organic and non-organic recyclable waste, which is a large part of the municipal solid waste generated, has caused increasing environmental concerns. The process of recycle is crucial for environmental sustainability. According to estimations from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, around 75 percent of the total waste can be recycled; and we only recycle 25 percent. The rest of the non-recycled waste is land filled and incinerated. By implementing new and novel recycling techniques, we can increase the recycling percentage and preserve natural resources and reuse the byproduct as industrial materials. The present paper presents an inexpensive yet reliable Smart Recycle Bin that based on modern technologies, such as environmental sensors and the LoRaWAn protocol to assist with the recycle process and automate the waste classification process. The proposed system can achieve 94.7% accuracy while it keeps the implementation costs complexity low, compared to similar projects found in literature. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={There is a general phenomenon of incoordination between garbage classification management and participation behavior, which seriously affects the sustainable management efficiency of domestic garbage. In order to solve this problem, this paper introduced the subject‐object‐process model into the waste classification management system, and constructed a mandatory classification management model of municipal solid waste and a comprehensive evaluation index system. Taking Beijing, China, as an example, the coupling coordination degree of garbage classification behaviors of residents in different was compared, and the coordination status of household waste management and behaviors was obtained. The results show that the synergy between government management and residents’ household waste classification behavior is between 0.40 and 0.68, and the synergy between enterprises’ participation in governance and residents’ behavior is between 0.45 and 0.75. The coordination degree between domestic waste management and residents’ participation behavior is generally in primary coordination or slight imbalance. The synergy degree between the secondary indicators of domestic waste management and residents’ behavior is higher than that of the tertiary indicators. Superposition effect of integrated management measures is better; among the psychological factors affecting residents’ classification behavior, the awareness rate and recog-nition degree of waste classification are very high, the awareness of environmental responsibility and social pressure are lagging behind. The study of synergy under the framework of subject‐object-process not only quantifies the overall synergy between management and residents’ behavior, but also provides a method to further implement garbage classification management in a targeted man-ner. Based on the synergy analysis, according to the weak links of various regions, classified management is carried out around publicity and education, supervision and management, assessment, rewards and punishments. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The main objective of this study is to classify domestic waste via computer vision and sort it automatically according to the four-category regulation. A novel two-stage Waste Recognition-Retrieval algorithm (W2R) is proposed. Its first stage was to train a Recognition Model (RegM) recognizing waste into one of thirteen subcategories. The second stage was to construct the Recognition-Retrieval Model (RevM) classifying the recognized subcategory into one of four categories. Meanwhile, a one-stage waste Classification Model (ClfM) was trained as a comparison. Both best-performing models were selected and installed respectively onto the automatic sorting machine for contrast experiment classifying a set of waste. The machine consisted of three main modules: the Computer-Vision Module, the Sorting Module, and the Customized Module. It was also a platform for data collection. Ten participants also classified and sorted the same set of waste in the experiment of Manual Sorting (MS). The experimental results show that the average accuracy of the RevM, 94.71% ± 1.69, was significantly higher than that of the ClfM-VGG, 69.66% ± 3.43, and that of the MS, 72.50% ± 11.37. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={With rapid population growth and urbanization, municipal solid waste (MSW) generation rates are rising around the world. Incineration is considered as an effective way to deal with the growing demand for MSW disposal. The prediction of concentrations of pollutants generated from MSW incineration plants is a powerful support for waste incineration process control, which aims to reduce pollutant emissions. This paper proposes a two-stage prediction method based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to forecast typical flue gas pollutants of an MSW incineration plant in South China. In the first stage, an LSTM-based classification model is utilized to determine whether the pollutants are at a low level, and over-sampling strategy is applied to deal with the class-imbalance problem. At the second stage, an LSTM-based prediction model is built to further estimate the amounts of pollutants. Besides, the sliding average method is used to process the multi-scale raw data. Experiment results proved the effectiveness of the proposed method and indicated how different inputs affect the forecasting of pollutant emissions. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The classification of municipal household waste is a complex, adaptive system containing multiple agents, where behavior between the agents is interactive. This study focuses on the willingness of bounded, rational individuals to sort waste within complex social networks, and the evolution of group behavior. An individual cognition-behavior model was established, based on the theory of planned behavior. In this model, the intention underpinning individual waste classification is influenced by the behavioral attitude of the individual, perceived behavioral control, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral results. A multi-agent-based simulation within a social network based on the opinion propagation dynamics and a scale-free network was developed to simulate the behavior change of the agents. The results suggest that under the principle of selective connection and the hypothesis of network growth, the clustering trend of the whole network towards several central nodes becomes increasingly apparent; this means, the degree of network node centralization becomes clear. Lowering the threshold of social information interaction improved the transmission of waste classification information and increased the proportion of urban residents who carry out waste classification. Economic profits and spiritual satisfaction were considered important driving factors that impacted decision-making on waste classification, and effectively stimulated the willingness of urban residents to implement waste sorting behavior. Notably, official organizations and institutions, that is, influencers with higher connectivity were found to have a greater influence on the decisions made by residents. These findings are useful as a theoretical reference to inform the development of waste management policies. © 2021},

abstract={With the rapid increase in household waste, environmental degradation becomes more serious. It is imperative to promote household waste sorting in China. Therefore, this paper mainly studies the influencing factors of intention and behavior for household waste sorting. An extended theory of planned behavior (TPB) theoretical model is established by integrating TPB with the theory of environmental regulation. We investigate the moderating roles of knowledge, moral obligation and personal involvement on the relationship between perceived behavior control and low-carbon household waste sorting behavior. Based on 441 valid questionnaires data and structure equation model and multiple regression analysis and differencing analysing, we found that environmental regulation has the highest effect on behavioral intention for household waste sorting, followed by perceived behavioral control and attitude toward house waste sorting in the extended TPB model. In addition, intention and perceived behavior control for household waste sorting positively impact on behavior, followed by perceived behavior control. Knowledge, personal involvement, and moral responsibility have a positive moderating effect on the mechanism between perceived behavior control and household waste sorting behavior, respectively. It is important to enhance the residents' responsibility, personal involvement, and knowledge for household waste soring in China. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Restaurant food waste (RFW) can be separated from other municipal solid waste (MSW) for individual treatment or treated together with other MSW, and it is disputed which option is the optimal strategy for MSW management in the practice of Shenzhen, China. To weigh pros and cons of RFW separation, a hybrid life cycle assessment is conducted to compare (S1) all MSW incineration and (S2) individual anaerobic digestion of RFW and other MSW incineration referring to the real situation. The results show that S2 reduces 10.6% carbon emission than S1, mainly owing to higher heat value of incineration feedstock and higher yield of electricity. In addition, the cumulative energy demands of S1 and S2 are − 6290 and − 6544 MJ/t MSW, and their energy efficiencies are 67.4 and 70.3%, respectively. Moreover, RFW separation reduces acidic gases emission due to the substitution effect of more energy products. Overall, source sorting of RFW is a sustainable model of MSW management at Shenzhen, and the result provides quantitative support for the strategy of RFW separation from MSW. © 2021, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Sorting of recyclables from source-segregated municipal solid waste (MSW) stream is an essential step in the recycling chain in a material recovery facility (MRF) for waste management. Manual sorting of recyclables in an MRF is a highly hazardous operation for human health as well as time-consuming. Application of robotics for automated waste sorting can alleviate these problems to a large extent. The total sorting time depends upon the pick-and-place (PAP) sequence used in a robotic sorting system. In this context, the generation of optimal PAP sequence plan is a key challenge considering that it cannot be solved by an exhaustive search due to the combinatorial explosion of the search space. This paper reports an approach for generating optimal PAP sequence plan for robotic sorting of recyclables from source-segregated MSW stream in a system equipped with thermal-imaging technique. The PAP sequence generation is formulated as an optimization problem wherein the objective is to minimize the total sorting time. The formulated problem has been solved using a genetic algorithm (GA)-based approach. Numerical simulations as well as physical experiments using a 6 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) articulated manipulator have been performed to test and validate the developed optimal sequence generation algorithm. Results revealed an improvement of up to 4.28% speedup in total sorting time over that of randomly generated sequences. It is envisaged that the developed approach can substantially improve the sorting performance in an MRF. © 2020 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Saudi Arabia) has started implementing the National Transformation Program (NTP) that aims to achieve government operational excellence, improve economic factors, and improve living standards as the country faces a high annual population growth rate and rapid urbanization. These increases lead to an increase in the levels of different waste products, which also lead to an increase in environmental pollution, the spread of diseases, harmful gases, and unwanted odors. One of the serious challenges facing the authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is managing this municipal solid waste (MSW) in a sustainable way that ensures reducing the resulting damage and using it to generate environmentally friendly energies. According to recent studies, organic waste is the largest component of waste generated in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which makes the process of sorting organic waste an essential requirement for any waste system applied inside the country. This paper aims to suggest an automated system for sorting organic waste using the Internet of things in Mecca city. The proposed system aims to achieve the maximum benefit at a low cost and contribute to preserving the environment during the Hajj and Umrah period.

To predict the dependence of gross national income on municipal solid waste, a neural network was built based on the MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP), which predicts the time series. MLP is based on sigmoidal neurons. It was found that, based on a fuzzy model, in countries with a middle high-income population, the share of organic waste in MSW decreases, while the share of recyclable fractions increases. Based on statistical data, a fuzzy model was compiled for the classification of municipal solid waste depending on the level of well-being of the population and a methodology for teaching the fuzzy model algorithm was developed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The key to efficient waste management is to ensure segregation of waste and resource recovery. Waste is usually segregated on the basis of whether it is biodegradable or non biodegradable. A major challenge with respect to this is that waste materials are not segregated before collection and discarded nonetheless. These end up as huge piles of waste in dump yards and need to be segregated. Waste segregation is currently being done manually by the Municipal Corporation. This results in unsanitary working conditions for the people who need to perform this task. Despite being provided with the necessary equipment, they run the risk of catching infections from the waste they work with. Automation of this process will be beneficial for the people who work on this by reducing health hazards. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Municipal solid waste management has been one of the most critical issues of urban cities today. Increasing population, constructions, industries, etc. are the major factors creating a large amount of waste that is dumped onto the landfill sites. Various systems have been proposed and are under the utilization for the management of municipal waste which includes mechanical vibration-based size-based sorters, eddy current sensor-based sorting of metallic waste, automatic optical waste sorters, etc. This paper focuses on a novel solution for solid waste segregation using the concepts of machine vision and deep learning. The proposed concept is tested for the segregation of solid dry waste particularly plastic bottles, aluminum cans, and tetra packs. The prototype system developed for the segregations works at high speed and accuracy. The prototype system sorts 250 objects per minute with an average accuracy of 96%. The proposed novel idea be extended and implemented for other types of waste segregation and can include more categories of solid dry waste. The system provides a solution for the ever-challenging municipal waste management problem. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Recycling of post-consumer packaging wastes involves a complex chain of activ-ities, usually based on three main stages, that is: i) collection from households or recovery from Municipal solid waste (MSW), ii) sorting and, finally, iii) mechanical recycling. Among these activities contaminants detection and separation play a pre-eminent role. The utilization of a Near InfraRed (NIR) – HyperSpectral Imaging (HSI) based methods, along with chemometrics and machine learning techniques, can fulfill both the two previously mentioned goals. In this paper, the HSI-based sorting logics, to apply, to implement, to set up and to perform an automatic separation of paper, cardboard, plastics and multilayer packaging are investigated. The built PLS-DA-based cascading classification model allows to recognize polymeric fragments from cellulosic ones and to identify multi-layer materials (i.e. laminated plastic and laminated cardboard). The misclassified fragments are constituted by laminated plastics. The set up cascade model reached in prediction a Recognition and a Re-liability of 0.933. The proposed NIR-HSI-based approach can represent an optimal, reliable and low-cost answer to systematically identify impurities and composite materials inside plastic waste streams. © 2020 Cisa Publisher.

abstract={Only around 30 % of the 27.1 million tonnes of plastic waste recovered annually in Europe is being recycled efficiently into new products. The most common way to recycle plastics nowadays is through mechanical recycling methods that involve sorting plastics by type, melting them and reprocessing into recycled products. Mechanical recycling requires clean, high-purity mono-material streams, that must be obtained by separation at source (by the citizen or industry) or by manual or automated sorting of mixed waste streams. However, this degree of separation is very difficult or even impossible due to composition or contamination of the plastic waste, such is the case for example of complex materials like composites, made of more than one material that in most cases cannot be separated, and of highly contaminated plastic residues (e.g. food packaging). In economic terms, plastic recycling is not always cost-efficient since many times recycling costs are not covered by the prices of the recycled plastics. As a result, approximately 70 % of European plastic waste is not recycled due to technical or economic reasons, so, they are sent to landfill or to incineration. One of the possible solutions to deal with this type of plastic wastes is the pyrolysis process which allows taking profit of plastics organic matter and tolerates a certain degree of contamination. Pyrolysis products have good quality. Gases have high calorific value and liquids have high energetic content and stability characteristics, including well-defined distillation point, stability of physical properties, low acidity, and high miscibility with conventional fuels. However, products obtained by plastic waste pyrolysis depend on the operational conditions and are strongly affected by the type of plastic waste used. The main purpose of this study is to validate the application of the pyrolysis process for treatment and transformation of plastic mix (essentially derived from MSW and from end-of-life composites) into mainly profitable liquids, together with gases and solid by using thermal (or catalytic) pyrolysis. The raw materials studied were waste streams from municipal solid waste (MSW), containing mainly plastic (i.e. PE, PP, PS, and small amounts of PET and PVC) separated from organic waste pool, as well as end-of-life composites (i.e. packages, electrical wastes, vehicles, etc.). After sorting of these waste materials, plastic fractions of different composition were processed in the pyrolysis reactor. The pyrolysis experiments were carried out in batch 5.5 L reactor using different mixtures, operational conditions and catalysts. All gaseous hydrocarbons produced were measured and collected for direct analysis by gas chromatography (GC), whilst liquid hydrocarbons were distilled and solids were extracted with hexane. Liquid fractions were analysed using a GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) to identify their main compounds, which were quantified by GC. The experimental results obtained showed that, for instance, the use of polystyrene favoured highly the formation of aromatic compounds, mainly toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene, while in presence of polyethylene the hydrocarbons produced are mainly paraffins. Also, the presence of PS, PET and PVC increases the solid content, decreasing the liquid yield. Copyright © 2021, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.},

abstract={Modern world meets a lot of challenges that includes smart waste management system. It becomes a big concern if proper disposal system is not managed. Managing of waste effectively and recycling efficiently is a major goal for every nation. There are many automatic waste material sorting facilities available, which are being used to sort metals, plastics and glass bottle wastes. Sorting plastics based on type of plastics, makes the plastics recycling process more effective. But segregation and sorting of black coloured plastics is a major problem while sorting plastics based on their types. Also, black plastics contains many harmful chemicals like bromide and other heavy metals, which may contaminate other recycling processes of plastics. Black plastics are used as food containers which leads to serious health concern. In this research work, the difficulty of sorting black plastics is done by developing an electromechanical system using microcontroller, which sorts all types of plastics. For sorting black plastic wastes, calibrated sensors and optimized algorithms have been developed and used. This sorting process makes plastics recycling process more effective. This automatic sorting machine and effective recycling of domestic wastes will make our environment more suitable for living. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

abstract={Achievement of precision measurement is highly desired in a current industrial revolution where a significant increase in living standards increased municipal solid waste. The current industry 4.0 standards require accurate and efficient edge computing sensors towards solid waste classification. Thus, if waste is not managed properly, it would bring about an adverse impact on health, the economy, and the global environment. All stakeholders need to realize their roles and responsibilities for solid waste generation and recycling. To ensure recycling can be successful, the waste should be correctly and efficiently separated. The performance of edge computing devices is directly proportional to computational complexity in the context of nonorganic waste classification. Existing research on waste classification was done using CNN architecture, e.g., AlexNet, which contains about 62,378,344 parameters, and over 729 million floating operations (FLOPs) are required to classify a single image. As a result, it is too heavy and not suitable for computing applications that require inexpensive computational complexities. This research proposes an enhanced lightweight deep learning model for solid waste classification developed using MobileNetV2, efficient for lightweight applications including edge computing devices and other mobile applications. The proposed model outperforms the existing similar models achieving an accuracy of 82.48% and 83.46% with Softmax and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers, respectively. Although MobileNetV2 may provide a lower accuracy if compared to CNN architecture which is larger and heavier, the accuracy is still comparable, and it is more practical for edge computing devices and mobile applications. © 2021 Leow Wei Qin et al.},

abstract={Plastic waste management is a challenge for the whole world. Manual sorting of garbage is a difficult and expensive process, which is why scientists create and study automated sorting methods that increase the efficiency of the recycling process. The plastic waste may be automatically chosen on a transmission belt for waste removal by using methods of image processing and artificial intelligence, especially deep learning, to improve the recycling process. Waste segregation techniques and procedures are applied to major groups of materials such as paper, plastic, metal, and glass. Though, the biggest challenge is separating different materials types in a group, for example, sorting different colours of glass or plastics types. The issue of plastic garbage is important due to the possibility of recycling only certain types of plastic (PET can be converted into polyester material). Therefore, we should look for ways to separate this waste. One of the opportunities is the use of deep learning and convolutional neural network. In household waste, the most problematic are plastic components, and the main types are polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene. The main problem considered in this article is creating an automatic plastic waste segregation method, which can separate garbage into four mentioned categories, PS, PP, PE-HD, and PET, and could be applicable on a sorting plant or home by citizens. We proposed a technique that can apply in portable devices for waste recognizing which would be helpful in solving urban waste problems. © 2021 Janusz Bobulski and Mariusz Kubanek.},

abstract={With the development of science and technology, China has basically realized the goal of building a moderately well-off society in an all-round way. As people's income and quality of life are constantly improving and their consumption level is gradually increasing, the quantity of household garbage is also growing rapidly. It is of great urgency to implement the classification and management of household garbage to make full use of garbage resources and reduce environmental pollution as well as land resource occupation. In order to conduct the classification and management work of household garbage more efficiently, this paper develops a garbage detecting system using a lightweight model MobileNetV3_Lite, which is promoted from MobileNetV3, as the backbone network to reduce computation and building up a YOLOV3-MobileNetV3_Lite detection model. The model successfully detects four categories of garbage, effectively and accurately determining the category and quantity of the waste. After the model is exported, deployed, and tested on NVIDIA Jetson Nano, the frame rate is up to 25. In the actual test, the accuracy for judging the category of garbage reached 94.56% and 90.91% for detecting the quantity of each category of garbage. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The level of dependence of the ecological state and its management in the Khmelnytsky region of Ukraine on the welfare of the population of this region is analyzed. The relationship between the level of income of the population of the region and the level of motivation of the same population in the sorting of buildings using a systematic approach within the ecological and economic system. The shift of consumption by the population of the region from the non-food sector to the food sector causes not only a change in parity in the triangle "man-business entity-nature", but also proves the lack of public interest in sorting household waste. This level of social responsibility and motivation of the region's population will indicate non-compliance with the goals of sustainable development of the region. The model of dependence of need for sorting of waste on the level of income of the population offered by us in article confirms it. The forecast of income growth of the population of Khmelnytsky region makes it possible to make assumptions about the growing interest of the population in sorting household waste, which will ultimately contribute to the sustainable development of the region. © 2021, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

abstract={The problem of domestic refuse is becoming more and more serious with the use of all kinds of equipment in medical institutions. This matter arouses people's attention. Traditional artificial waste classification is subjective and cannot be put accurately; moreover, the working environment of sorting is poor and the efficiency is low. Therefore, automated and effective sorting is needed. In view of the current development of deep learning, it can provide a good auxiliary role for classification and realize automatic classification. In this paper, the ResNet-50 convolutional neural network based on the transfer learning method is applied to design the image classifier to obtain the domestic refuse classification with high accuracy. By comparing the method designed in this paper with back propagation neural network and convolutional neural network, it is concluded that the CNN based on transfer learning method applied in this paper with higher accuracy rate and lower false detection rate. Further, under the shortage situation of data samples, the method with transfer learning and ResNet-50 training model is effective to improve the accuracy of image classification. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.},

abstract={The recently finalized research project “ZRR for municipal waste” aimed at testing and evaluating the automation of municipal waste sorting plants by supplementing or replacing manual sorting, with sorting by a robot with artificial intelligence (ZRR). The objectives were to increase the current recycling rates and the purity of the recovered materials; to collect additional materials from the current rejected flows; and to improve the working conditions of the workers, who could then concentrate on, among other things, the maintenance of the robots. Based on the empirical results of the project, this paper presents the main results of the training and operation of the robotic sorting system based on artificial intelligence, which, to our knowledge, is the first attempt at an application for the separation of bulky municipal solid waste (MSW) and an installation in a full-scale waste treatment plant.

abstract={Worldwide, public managers need to plan and implement sustainable alternatives for the management of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) that consider waste treatment plants. However, the selection of waste treatment alternatives is a complex process which must consider different criteria. In this sense, the present article had the objective of analyzing different MSW treatment alternatives for the municipality of Juazeiro do Norte in Ceará, Brazil, through the evaluation of economic, environmental, social, technical, and regulatory criteria. The Multicriteria Decision Making Method AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) was applied, supported by several quantitative techniques of projection and data collected in the field and in secondary sources. The results show that alternatives 1 (decentralized manual sorting center and composting units) and 3 (decentralized manual sorting center and anaerobic digesters) are the most favorable MSW treatment options for Juazeiro do Norte, with a percentage of 25,11 and 24,97%, respectively. The decentralized alternatives 1 and 3 have an advantage over the centralized alternatives 2 (automated sorting center and centralized composting unit), 4 (automated sorting center and centralized biodigester) and 5 (automated sorting center and incinerator) due, mainly, to the greater generation of jobs and technical feasibility. However, sensitivity analyzes enhances that, in an evaluation in which the economic criteria had a weight greater than or equal to 70%, the overall result would change significantly and the centralized alternatives 2 and 4, alternatives with better economic results, would be considered as the best MSW treatment options. © 2021, ABES - Associacao Brasileira de Engenharia Sanitaria e Ambiental.

abstract={Weeds in the corn field are extremely harmful to the growth of corn seedlings and should be controlled in time. The main domestic weeding method is still based on large-scale spraying of chemical agents. This method not only causes waste of resources, but also pollutes the environment.

First, this article introduces the design of the robot system. Then this article introduces the model generation subsystem. The system can identify the collected images and classify and locate the corn and weeds in the images. Next, this article introduces the communication subsystem. The communication subsystem realizes the remote control of the Spark robot, and can transfer the collected images to the model for detection.

abstract={A circular economy is a trendy word, which encompasses reaching of closed-loop in all industries. This also applies to the waste management sector, where new regulations and directives have been issued. Given milestones, however, do not have to correspond with economic or even environmental sustainability. Thus, it is more than necessary to evaluate waste management system using these criteria and present supportive or contradictory statements. An approach for such a complex assessment is proposed. It uses mathematical programming models and multi-objective strategy to suggest a suitable number and locations for waste treatment and pre-treatment facilities. Only main fractions of municipal solid waste are considered – plastic, paper, glass and mixed municipal waste. The environmental part covers the production of greenhouse gases respecting all processes in the system, excluding transportation. Based on comprehensive research, non-linear dependencies were estimated for costs and sorting efficiencies. The mathematical model uses an iterative procedure to avoid non-linearity. Afterwards, the case study of Czech treatment infrastructure is designed. The approach resulted in the establishment of 14, and 42 sorting lines for plastics and paper, respectively, supported by 20 Waste-to-Energy plants with different capacity. An interesting output says that in an optimal situation, out of total sorted plastics and paper, only 25% and 79% will be recycled, while the remaining amount ends up in Waste-to-Energy plant. Further research will include additional fractions, such as bio-waste, oils or textile, as it is being collected these days separately. Other directions involve new targets from the real-operated sorting lines and new conditions related to investment for more fractions treated at a single site. © 2020},

abstract={As an effective way to alleviate the current problem of garbage in China, garbage classification has been vigorously promoted by relevant government departments in recent years, but its actual performance is still not satisfactory. Therefore, in view of the current difficulties in the treatment of domestic garbage and the promotion of garbage classification in China, we have implemented the extraction of household garbage information based on the Internet of Things technology and mechanical design. Through management methods and information management systems, we can achieve the traceability of household garbage to individuals and follow up in the process of treatment. An innovative garbage collection and transportation treatment model was designed to solve the social pain points to the greatest extent, promote residents to carry out garbage classification independently, and increase the proportion of garbage resource treatment. The current design products mainly include two-dimensional code sorting garbage bags, recognizable sorting household barrels, intelligent split type garbage bins and garbage information management system, and have established a relatively complete management and operation system and points reward and punishment system, which effectively promote the national garbage classification process. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={There are relatively few studies on the spray quality of citrus tree canopy in China. In most cases, the method is that farmers observe the spray quality of citrus tree canopy up close in the orchard, which wastes manpower and material resources. Moreover, the observation effect is not ideal and may cause harm to human safety. Domestic conditions allow some orchards to judge the spray effect by observing the water-sensitive paper. This method does save a lot of manpower, and efficiency is significantly improved compared with the previous ones. However, this method is affected by the external environment, and the naked eyes cannot correctly determine the spray quality, which will cause certain errors. Therefore, this study explored new ways to solve these problems. In recent years, thermal imaging technology had shown great research promise in some emerging research areas, especially in agricultural production. In the field of precision agriculture, for example, high-resolution thermal imaging cameras, with the aid of advanced aerial photography technology, can quickly capture thermal images of the canopy before and after spray, which provides new ideas for precision agriculture spray detection technology. This study combined thermal imaging technology and computer vision technology to identify and classify the spray conditions of the plant canopy and accurately detected the spray quality of the leaves, which avoided the waste of pesticides and reduced the manual re-examination steps. Thereby reducing agricultural production costs and improving the economic benefits of agricultural products. In this study, the canopy of a citrus tree was used as a thermal image acquisition area. Inevitably, there are problems such as high noise, low contrast, and blurred feature information in the thermal image acquisition process. In response to the above problems, this study preprocessed the acquired thermal images and eliminated unreasonable data, and set the original data set to two labels (sprayed and unsprayed), and divided them into the training set and the test set. An improved SPP-Net-Inception-v4 model based on the Inception-v4 model and the SPP-Net target detection algorithm was proposed to achieve multi-feature fusion to enhance the feature extraction effect. The model took the construction of a sparse network structure to generate dense data as the core design idea. By introducing the Inception and Reduction modules, the feature description bottleneck problem was reduced; further, SPP-Net (Spatial Pyramid Pooling Network) was innovatively connected between the convolutional layer and the fully connected layer pooling network), which aimed to extract fixed-length feature vectors through the pyramid space pooling method to achieve the fusion of multi-scale features and extraction enhancement effect. Compared with the two models of Inception-v4 and ResNet-152, the experimental results showed that the accuracy of the improved SPP-Net-Inception-v4 model test set was 95.07%, which was 1.58% higher than the accuracy of the original Inception-v4 model and 3.26% higher than that of ResNet-152. Compared with Inception-v4 and ResNet-152, the SPP-Net-Inception-v4 model reduced the model size by 13% and 24%, respectively. The SPP-Net-Inception-v4 model could be used to detect the spray quality of chemicals in citrus fruit trees quickly as well as could improve the economic benefits of agricultural production, and would provide a reference for the further improvement of pesticide detection technology in precision agriculture. © 2020, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

abstract={The main aim of this study was to examine residents’ environmental behavior in sorting solid household waste, and to identify the integrative factors that contribute to their wasteseparation cooperation and other related pro-environmental behaviors. This was achieved based on a questionnaire survey in Shenyang, Chengdu, and Shanghai. Methodologically, we applied a discrete choice model to examine whether individuals’ garbage sorting behaviors differ based on their characteristics, social attributes, residential circumstances, and environmental awareness, and whether these factors are correlated with individuals’ receptiveness to a refuse charge system, or to policies requiring garbage sorting. We further examined whether individuals’ garbage sorting behavior, their receptiveness to fee-based waste collection, and their receptiveness to policies requiring garbage sorting differ across areas. In this particular survey, we introduced a 16 item scale of pro-environmental behavior and a nine item scale of altruism to ascertain the ways in which internal motivational factors affect people’s environmentally conscious voluntary behavior. Overall, the present work is expected to contribute to an important understanding of the motivational forces and incentives behind human pro-environmental behavior and action. It also brings relevance to the analysis of moral solidarity in relation to the household waste disposal problems currently confronting us today. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={The settling behavior of aerobic granular sludge (AGS) in full-scale reactors is different from the settling of normal activated sludge. Current activated sludge models lack the features to describe the segregation of granules based on size during the settling process. This segregation plays an important role in the granulation process and therefore a better understanding of the settling is essential. The goal of this study was to model and evaluate the segregation of different granule sizes during settling and feeding in full-scale aerobic granular sludge reactors. Hereto the Patwardhan and Tien model was used. This model is an implementation of the Richardson and Zaki model, allowing for multiple classes of particles. To create the granular settling model, the most relevant parameters were identified using aerobic granular sludge from different full-scale Nereda® reactors. The settling properties of individual granules were measured as was the bulk behavior of granular sludge beds with uniform granular sludge particles. The obtained parameters were combined in a model containing multiple granule classes, which then was validated for granular sludge settling in a full-scale Nereda® reactor. In practice a hydraulic selection pressure is used to select for granular sludge. Under the same hydraulic selection pressure the model predicted that different stable granular size distributions can occur. This indicates that granular size distribution control would need a different mechanism then the hydraulic selection pressure alone. This model can be used to better understand and optimize operational parameters of AGS reactors that depend on granular sludge size, like biological nutrient removal. Furthermore insights from this model can also be used in the development of continuously fed AGS systems. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={Pollution from discarded plastic has become a serious environmental problem. The Great Pacific garbage patch consisting of abandoned plastics is killing marine life. In addition, micro-plastics decomposed by solar UV radiation and waves can accumulate in the human body. Recycling plastic is accordingly a critical element of waste management. As part of the solution to this problem, factory automation in recycling plants to handle more waste faster is essential. The amount of reproduced raw plastics is proportional to the inlet speed of the plastics waste stream into a recycling process line. Furthermore, the quality of recycled products with reproduced raw plastics depends on the sorting purity through the line. Thus, an automated system should be capable of real-time classification of the plastics category and rapid manipulation for removing selected plastics. We propose a real-time sorting system for mixed color plastics by applying a machine learning algorithm and a parallel manipulator with a vacuum suction pad. The learning data and picking test samples were collected from a municipal waste disposal site at RM corporation factory. This work shows the feasibility of real-time plastics recycling automation and a future development direction. © 2020 Institute of Control, Robotics, and Systems - ICROS.},

abstract={Flexible and reliable probability density estimation is fundamental in unsupervised learning and classification. Finite Gaussian mixture models are commonly used for this purpose. However, the parametric form of the distribution is not always known. In this case, non-parametric density estimation methods are used. Usually, these methods become computationally demanding as the number of components increases. In this paper, a comparative study of accuracy of some nonparametric density estimators is made by means of simulation. The following approaches have been considered: an adaptive bandwidth kernel estimator, a projection pursuit estimator, a logspline estimator, and a k-nearest neighbor estimator. It was concluded that data clustering as a pre-processing step improves the estimation of mixture densities. However, in case data does not have clearly defined clusters, the pre-preprocessing step does not give that much of advantage. The application of density estimators is illustrated using municipal solid waste data collected in Kaunas (Lithuania). The data distribution is similar (i.e., with kurtotic unimodal density) to the benchmark distribution introduced by Marron and Wand. Based on the homogeneity tests it can be concluded that distributions of the municipal solid waste fractions in Kutaisi (Geor-gia), Saint-Petersburg (Russia), and Boryspil (Ukraine) are statistically indifferent compared to the distribution of waste fractions in Kaunas. The distribution of waste data collected in Kaunas (Lithuania) follows the general observations introduced by Marron and Wand (i.e., has one mode and certain kurtosis). © 2020 The Author(s).},

abstract={The rapid urbanization process is escalating the urban waste problem, and ineffective management has worsened the issue, leading to severe consequences to the population health and economy. Although many countries have started to charge money for large household items, it is time-consuming and challenging for collectors to distinguish various types of bulky waste manually. As a result, this study introduces a mobile-based automatic bulky waste classification system. The original contributions include (1) a fine-tuned VGG-19 model is proposed to classify 95 types of bulky wastes; (2) three hybrid models are introduced to efficiently handle the imbalanced data problem, including class-weight VGG-19 (CW_VGG19), eXtreme Gradient Boosting VGG-19 (XGB_VGG19), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine VGG-19 (LGB_VGG19); (3) a large dataset that includes 95 classes, and each class contains over 500 images; and (4) the development of a mobile application that used the proposed model. Experiments show that the model obtained an accuracy of 86.19%, which outperforms existing models in classifying bulky waste. Moreover, the proposed hybrid models showed their robustness against imbalanced data under various scenarios. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Factors promoting satisfaction and engagement with waste sorting were investigated. An extended theoretical model was established by integrating the theories of consumer satisfaction and customer engagement, rather than customer loyalty. Full replies to 672 valid questionnaires were obtained from respondents in 31 Chinese provinces. This paper explored how the perceived value of waste sorting, sorting facilities, income, age, and education affect waste sorting satisfaction. This paper also analyzed the effect of satisfaction on engagement in terms of enthusiasm, social interaction, and active participation by region and gender using multiple-group structural equation modeling (SEM). The results revealed perceived value of sorting and good sorting facilities can enhance satisfaction. Satisfaction can enhance enthusiasm, social interaction, and active participation. Education level, income and age would influence satisfaction and three dimensions of engagement: enthusiasm, social interaction and active participation. Waste sorting satisfaction affected enthusiasm, social interaction, active participation to a greater extent in eastern versus middle and western regions of China. It is important to provide market-incentives, such as green points reward, deposit refund, to promote household waste sorting. © 2020},

abstract={In this paper the plastic sorting system of the waste processing line is considered. Plastic is a valuable raw material for recycling but only 10% of plastic waste is processed nowadays in Russia. Two main methods of waste recognition are applied in two separation stages: spectrometry and computer vision. The implementation of municipal solid waste sorting system using the near infrared and visible spectrum spectrometers can significantly increase the efficiency of separation process in comparison with manual sorting. But the quality of separation is still low because this plastic cannot be separated by color using this method and a lot of impurities are included. The evident conclusion is the need for two-stage of sorting process: the rough but fast sorting using spectrometry and fine sorting using optical methods. Another issues of this paper are related to optical recognition subsystem: we propose a fast multi-level recognition system, the first level is the detection of the object presence on the line and the analysis of camera focusing, the second is the classification of the plastic object using the joint solution of several neural networks. This approach helps to decrease the total operating time by estimating the necessity of neural network running and by avoiding the blurred and faulty image processing. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Composting can be used to reduce the volume of perishable food waste and increase soil fertility. In this study, an innovative composting device was developed to rapidly crush food waste at home. A special thermophilic microbial agent (Consists of four different functioning microorganisms) was prepared from the local food waste and rotted wood to facilitate degradation. After composting for four days with our device and microbial agent, the water-soluble organic carbon to total organic nitrogen ratio (WSOC/TON) in the mature compost was less than 0.55, the germination index (GI) reached 89.7 %, the pH value was 5.57 and the electrical conductivity (EC) was 1984 μS cm−1. The mature compost met the soil quality standards and was qualified as planting soil. This techno-economic evaluation shows that our domestic composting model saves labor, transport and classification costs compared with the centralized composting system, and presents new disposal and management model of domestic waste. The total cost of our device was only $0.033 per kg for food waste. Taking the disposal fee saved into account, the net profit of the mature compost was $89.06 per year. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers},

abstract={Recycling of waste from households and industries, is one of the methods that has been proposed to reduce the ever-increasing pressure on landfills. Different types of waste types warrant different management techniques and hence, proper waste segregation according to its types is essential to facilitate proper recycling. Current existing segregation method still relies on manual hand-picking process. In this paper, a method; based on deep learning and computer vision concepts, to classify wastes using their images into six different waste types (glass, metal, paper, plastic, cardboard and others) has been proposed. Multiple-layered Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, specifically the well-known Inception-v3 model has been used for classification of waste, with trained dataset obtained from online sources. High classification accuracy of 92.5% is achievable using the proposed method. It is envisaged that the proposed waste classification method would pave the way for the automation of waste segregation with reduced human involvement and therefore, helps with the waste recycling efforts. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={In urban households such as houses and condominiums in the city, there are a lot of cases where people waste huge amount of clean water in irrigating plants. Siling Labuyo is a common spice in the Philippines and apparently, birds are one of the few who can eat Siling Labuyo Peppers in urban areas. This paper tackles the use of a Raspberry Pi model 3B+ to control an automated irrigation system with a bird deterrent system. The irrigation system is based on evapotranspiration referenced by the Penman-Monteith equation. It estimates the net evapotranspiration using solar radiation, temperature, humidity, and wind speed as parameters. It aims to determine the significance of the system when it comes to the total number of fruits produced per plant in a span of 6 weeks. Image processing was used for the bird detection, Opencv was used for object detection, using a trained Haar cascade model in order to detect birds. While a rotating red light was used for the bird deterrence. The Raspberry Pi controls the water flow for the irrigation system and the switching of the light for the bird deterrent system. This paper concludes that: the ET-based irrigation system does not affect the number of fruits produced by the plant as compared to the usage of the traditional irrigation system, the ET-based irrigation system saved 15931.7238 mL of water compared to the traditional irrigation system, and the rotating red light was an effective way to deter the Eurasian tree sparrow "Maya"birds. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={With the continuous growth of the cruise market in China, more and more port cities are involved in the cruise industry. At present, the development mode of each port is mainly determined by the location according to the urban development plan and industrial development plans. Due to the lack of overall planning within the region, the competition and waste of resources in the region are often happened in the early stage of port construction. In order to avoid such contradictions and improve the development efficiency of domestic cruise ports, a set of measurable and operable classification development model evaluation system is developed for the new entrants. On the basis of the empirical analysis of all domestic cruise ports, this paper analyses the development factors such as city grade, traffic status, tourism heat, port type and so on, combines the development achievements of each port, carries on the fuzzy cluster analysis to each port, forms the comprehensive classification table of China cruise port development mode, and then formulates the classification of cities to be identified by fuzzy recognition scheme. The empirical analysis shows that the comprehensive classification and development model established by the study is feasible and in line with the industry expectations. The study provides an effective basis for choosing development mode for new cruise ports in the future to avoid regional conflicts and achieve win-win regional development. © 8th International Symposium on Project Management, ISPM 2020.

abstract={Implementing circular business models in food supply chains is an organizational solution to tackle the issue of household food waste, converting it in feedstock to upcycle within industrial symbioses. Adopting literature on practices of food consumption as theoretical framework, this paper analyzes consumers’ participation in circular business models. A conceptual model of the emergence of food provisioning practices in circular business models is designed and empirically tested, through a survey, in order to analyze consumers’ willingness to participate in an innovative food provisioning mechanism with retailers. Respondents were asked to choose whether to participate or not in a proposed program, and their choices have been modelled in an ordered logit model. 88% of interviewees declared sorting organic food waste as a normal activity in his household. 78.9% of participants accepted to participate to the proposed programs independently of the type of agreement's attributes. 14.49% accepted only some programs depending on the program type, while 6.61% of respondents choose not to participate to any of the proposed program. Findings outline the expected participant as an individual already engaged in tasks to cope with risk in food provisioning and having already developed a long-lasting relation with a retailer. The study reveals also the opposite effect of concerns about tasks related to take-back system, such as food waste handling, and social desirability of recycling. Focusing on the business-to-consumers relationship, the paper suggests to practitioners interested in circular business models the possibility to adopt innovative ‘food-product-as-a-service’ approaches. Recommendations can be derived for future studies about the relevance of practice theory in the analysis of consumers’ engagement in circular business models. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to provide a full characterization of post-consumer plastic film recovered from mixed municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment plants in Spain. Currently, this type of plastic waste is not recycled due to technical or economic barriers and is still sent to landfill. Different types of municipal plastic waste (MPW) from manual and automated sorting were studied: i) colour plastic film recovered by ballistic separators and then manual sorting in different seasons; ii) colour plastic film recovered by automated sorting (air suction); and iii) white plastic film from primary manual sorting process. The samples were characterized by different techniques, including the ultimate and proximate analysis, Higher Heating Value (HHV) and Lower Heating Value (LHV), metal content, Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Derivative Thermogravimetry (DTG), Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) analysis and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The results were compared to those obtained for pretreated colour and white plastic film waste and contrasted with industrial recycled film granules of polyethylene (as a reference material for packaging film). Additionally, pretreated plastic film samples were also characterized by analyzing viscosity, Pressure-Volume-Temperature (PVT) diagram, specific heat capacity and halogen and sulphur contents. Characterization data from this study will contribute to identify and develop potential recycling alternatives for a more sustainable municipal plastic waste management, which is recognized as a priority in the European Circular Economy Action Plan to use resources in a more sustainable way. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Large amounts of municipal sewage sludge are generated every year. Composting is one of the most popular and cost-effective methods of handling this waste. It is particularly important to carry out the composting of sewage sludge in an efficient way. The identification of the stage of early maturity of composted material is crucial. The objective of this study was to check the possibility of using convolutional neural networks to classify the early maturity of compost made from sewage sludge and rapeseed straw. The literature review showed that this specific and modern type of neural network had not been investigated for this purpose before. A mixture of these two substrates, composted for 25 days in 7 experiments, was the research material. Images of the material samples were acquired in a dedicated photo station illuminated with: visible light, ultraviolet light, and mixed visible and ultraviolet light. For each acquisition variant 1312 images were obtained. On the basis of the acquired images, 25 convolutional neural networks with one convolutional layer and a varied number of convolution filters were developed to determine the stage of early maturity of the material. Their classification error ranged from 0.51% to 17.77%. The best classification result was obtained for the model containing 16 convolution filters and based on images of the material acquired in mixed visible and ultraviolet light. The results presented in this paper have shown that convolutional neural networks are an adequate tool to assess compost maturity. Such models may provide a simplified and cost-effective approach to the approximate evaluation of the early maturity of compost. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={With the acceleration of urbanization in China, the living standard of urban residents has been improved, and the amount of domestic waste produced has been increasing year by year. The problem of urban domestic waste has become an urgent environmental problem to be solved in China, and the residents' garbage classification habits and awareness are the decisive factors to solve the current predicament of garbage siege and reduce environmental pollution, while with the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, it brings convenience to the classification of domestic garbage. Therefore, this paper analyzes the impact of technology on the classification habits of household garbage from the perspective of artificial intelligence environment, and constructs an information interaction intervention and collaborative classification model. Finally, through the simulation experiment to analyze the influence of the model on the formation and stability of residents' garbage classification behavior habits, the research results show that high response validity is conducive to the formation and stability of residents' garbage classification behavior habits, and low response validity has a slow convergence rate on the impact of behavior habits. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={A practical approach to deal With the municipal solid Waste at hand needs the adoption of a suitable model and an understanding of the required processes to manage it effectively. A case study of Bhubaneswar City/ Municipal Corporation of Odisha in India, focused on the development of a suitable model based on approaches like Process of elimination, Strength, Weakness, Opportunity and Threat (SwOT) analysis, Mathematical analysis, Analytical Hierarchy Process and the Test of sustainability. The study focused on the processes in Municipal Solid Waste (MSw) value chain like Waste generation, primary source storage, collection, secondary storage, transportation, processing and disposal. A two by two matrix model Was adopted to arrive at a suitable disposal model mapped With the source segregation. The Urban Local Body (ULB) analysed Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) as one of the criteria to select suitable Collection, Transportation and Disposal Model based on Technical, Economic, Social and Environmental considerations .The mathematical analysis involved Pair-wise Comparison Matrix for the quantitative variables While qualitative variables Were examined by Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). The economic factor dominated the decision making; ‘street dumping and street sweeping’ got an upper ranking in the final matrix analysis of the collection and Transportation plan and ‘incineration’ dominated the decision making for the disposal plan. The limitation of the study showed that the application of mathematical model to find out optimum Municipal Solid Waste (MSw) Model does not accommodate qualitative variables. Therefore, SwOT analysis and sustainability studies Were examined to arrive at the best possible model. SwOT criteria dreW upon the Work environment With respect to financial position of the Urban Local Body, Not in my backyard (NIMBY) factor, Private Public Partnership (PPP) mode aspirants, availability of mature technology and threat in factors like adverse regulatory order, disruptive technologies and the lack of political Will. The test of sustainability based on the proposed model passed through the test of capability and constraint study, social acceptance, regulatory compliance, and ground level feasibility. Based on multiple criteria in decision making, the study found that ideally Bhubaneswar should adopt a model Where source segregation With door to door collection of Waste facility is given top priority. Decentralization of Waste disposal and cluster approach of cities and towns nearby to curb the Waste menace and facilitate the Waste to go the fuel Way looked sustainable and achievable. At the same time, addressing the Not in my backyard (NIMBY) factor by earmarking land bank for Waste disposal and collection of cesses from the city inhabitants could generate enough financial resources for its sustainability. This research unbolts discussions With respect to the challenges presented by the Not in my backyard (NIMBY) factor, finding suitable landfill sites for solid Waste disposal, interference of disruptive technologies and the change in leadership not owning up to responsibilities or revoking the previously established management practices. Sustainability studies should help all stakeholders to participate harmoniously With a common goal of clean city and striving for a better planet. Similarly, the comparative matrix based on the scientific, financial, social and ecological considerations Were applied to the disposal plan to develop a fitting model for the Urban Local Body (ULB). The study ascertained that Bhubaneswar should have source segregation With door to door collection facility and may need decentralized composting facility centres to handle the biodegradable Wastes. The plastic Wastes may be used for Waste to Fuel or for road making. The non-degradable may go to land fill or Waste to Energy plant With cluster approach combining nearby Cuttack and Khurdha districts to meet the Waste requirement of 550 tonnes per day to sustain the plant. At the same time, it should collect cess from the city habitants to generate enough financial resources for sustainability. It should earmark the land-bank for Waste processing facilities as it faces serious law and Order problems due to Not in my backyard (NIMBY) factor. © 2020 by ASERS® Publishing.

abstract={Studies to date have shown that individual pro-environmental motivations do not always translate into pro-environmental behaviors. An important factor that modifies motivational strength is the context in which the behavior is embedded. Previous studies have largely been cross-national analyses that focus on macro-contextual factors, thus ignoring substantial variation in motivation-behavior associations at the local scale. In contrast, this study investigated the way micro-contextual mechanisms in residential areas (housing estates and communities) moderate the behavioral effects of personal values, one of the most fundamental motivations that guide individual environmental behaviors. Four contextual factors with particular attention were community environmental initiatives, social capital, local demographics, and built characteristics. The research data derived from a large-scale survey in Hangzhou, China, where community initiatives have been implemented widely to target household waste source separation. We examined our cross-level model for both waste sorting and nontarget environmental behaviors. The results showed that the associations between self-transcendent value prioritizations and waste sorting were stronger in residential areas with lower populations or community initiatives’ greater reliance on public-interest framing. Associations between value prioritizations and nontarget private behaviors were stronger in areas with lower social capital, more females, or more communal space for neighbor interactions. However, no contextual factors changed the strength of the links between value prioritizations and public behaviors. Overall, these findings highlight the significant role of micro-contextual factors in explaining the variations in motivation-behavior links. They also indicate that the characteristics of environmental behavior may moderate the dynamics between pro-environmental motivations and contextual factors further. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Civil participation is the main component of effective governance. The topicality of this paper lies in civil participation in decision-making defined by the principles of “new public governance” of the 21st century. This study aims to analyze the impact of civil participation in decision-making on waste management at the municipal level. In this work, the following aspects were considered: theoretical assumptions of civil participation; civil participation in the activities of institutions responsible for environmental protection; issues regarding the development of opportunities of citizens' involvement in municipal waste management. The article is devoted to the theoretical assumptions about civil participation, theoretical model of analysis, and activity of institutions. To develop a theoretical model of analysis, a classification of civil participation was carried out. Among the methods used, one can mention the questionnaire. The analysis was focused on a legal basis for the activity of institutions; the actual activity of institutions and survey of representatives of the national environmental authorities in Lithuania. The results showed that currently there is no mechanism in Lithuania to ensure civil participation in municipal waste management. Civil participation is still formal and limited. Overall, citizens are informed about the decisions made, but they do not participate actively in decision-making. The analysis of civil participation capacity in waste management leads to the conclusion that Lithuania has no single mechanism to ensure civil participation in waste management. To enhance civil participation in decision-making on waste management, it is suggested to set up a council where the representatives of civil population are delegated. © Andrius Stasiukynas, Vainius Smalskys, Arvydas Survila, Volodimyr Yermachenko, Nataliia Gavkalova, 2020},

abstract={Mekelle City is among the most rapidly growing cities in Ethiopia though the management of wastewater is very poor. The city lacks proper infrastructures for the collection and treatment of urban wastewater so that the wastewater released from different sectors directly joins the urban drainage of the city that finally flows to the Ellala River, which crosses the city. However, such practices have the potential to contaminate water reservoirs and surface water and groundwater bodies that endangers the health of the nearby society. Hence, to reduce and manage the wastewater impact sustainably, introducing natural treatment mechanisms like waste stabilization pond technology (WSP) is an ultimate means to implement with low cost and technology demand. Hence, the objective of this study was to select suitable sites for WSP sites to treat domestic wastewater of the city. During the process of WSP selection, nine most important parameters were considered namely groundwater, hydrogeology, slope, elevation, soil depth, land use land cover (LULC), distance from the settlement, from the road, and from the river. Those determinant factors affecting site selection were generated from satellite images, maps, and Digital Elevation Model. Supervised image classification for Landsat TM satellite image was done while the rest variables’ geo-database files were generated in ArcGIS interface software. Since all input variables have not equal influence in WSP site selection, the weighted value of variable estimation was undertaken using the algorism weighted combination formula. And finally, the weighted overlay model was used to run the model so that suitable sites were selected. Result shows that the city has a large number of alternative sites for establishing a waste stabilization pond. Five classes of suitability were generated (from low to very high suitability level). The North West and Northern parts of the city are found in the potential candidates’ areas as of the central and southern parts. Geographically, these areas are topographically gentle slope and have low altitude plus the newly designed sewer line network outlet lies in this direction. In contrast, unsuitable areas are found in the East, Central, and South direction of the study area. These selected areas are characterized by high population density, steep slope, and high topography. Groundwater, elevation, hydrogeology, and slope were found the most influential parameters determining WSP site selection. On the other hand, distance from road and river, land use cover, and soil depth were found the least influential parameters that determine WSP selection. Out of the total mml area, 21.3% were found highly suitable. So, this implies that the city has a large potential area that can be used for WSP establishment. From the present study, it can be concluded that GIS is a very essential tool in urban utility establishment like urban domestic wastewater treatment site selection. Although the city has adequate potential areas for establishing WSP, further assessment of flood vulnerability, biochemical determination, wastewater amount quantification, population growth, and urban expansion need to be seriously considered before implementing. © 2020, Saudi Society for Geosciences.},

abstract={The recycling of plastics from Waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) was constrained by the mix of types. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is suitable for polymer detection, and it is a rapid, non-destructive analysis method that can be applied to automatic on-line sorting system. The NIR spectra of four commonly recovered WEEE plastics, which are polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene/polycarbonate (ABS/PC) blend, was collected. The flame-retardant ABS showed difference from ABS in NIR spectra. Three classification methods, which are spectral angle mapper (SAM), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and linear discriminant analysis combined with principal component analysis (PCA-LDA), was tested. And the classification models trained on the virgin plastics have been compared with the models trained on the WEEE plastic to evaluate how these methods perform under limited training data. PLS-DA is one of the most widely used classification method in spectral data analysis, but it had unsuccessful prediction when the training set only included virgin plastics. But the overall prediction accuracy over 99% could be achieved by the other two whether the training set was the spectra of virgin plastics or WEEE plastics. In general, NIR spectroscopy has the competency of separating WEEE plastics. Finally, an automatic on-line sorting system was designed specifically for the large plastic segments from household appliances and electronics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A perennial crisis of growing waste accumulations and natural resource depletion are major challenges for most parts of the world today, of which many have explored recycling as a solution. However, recycling is impeded by the need to sort waste by material types before processing. Additionally, the composition of municipal solid waste is so random such that the processes cost more than the value of recyclables. This research aimed at increasing the quantum of waste recycled, by using waste sorting machines at large institutions such as universities and hospitals. Unlike municipal solid waste, the composition of the waste from such institutions was less random and could be analysed through waste characterisation and sorting. Waste characterisation was conducted for a university and the data directly integrated into the design and subsequent calibration of a customized and automated waste sorting machine. The modular and calibratable machine capable of sorting 200kg of waste per hour was designed, with an estimated cost of USD 5,966.72. The automated design was sound and sustainable, based on the simulation and stress analysis carried out, capable of achieving 12m travel distance per item and at least 85% accuracy in sorting, with Von Misses stresses not exceeding 0.168 MPa. © IEOM Society International.},

abstract={In cities, a large amount of municipal solid waste has impacted on the ecological environment significantly. Automatic and robust waste detection and classification is a promising and challenging problem in urban solid waste disposal. The performance of the classical detection and classification method is degraded by some factors, such as various occlusion and scale differences. To enhance the detection model robustness to occlusion and small items, we proposed a robust waste detection method based on a cascade adversarial spatial dropout detection network(Cascade ASDDN). The hard examples with occlusion in pyramid feature space are generated and used to adversarial training a detection network. Hard samples are generated by the spatial dropout module with Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping. The experiment verifies the effectiveness of our method on the 2020 Haihua AI challenge waste classification. © 2020 SPIE},

abstract={Waste management leads to the demolition of waste conducted by recycling and landfilling. Deep learning and the Internet of things (IoT) confer an agile solution in classification and real-time data monitoring, respectively. This paper reflects a capable architecture of the waste management system based on deep learning and IoT. The proposed model renders an astute way to sort digestible and indigestible waste using a convolutional neural network (CNN), a popular deep learning paradigm. The scheme also introduces an architectural design of a smart trash bin that utilizes a microcontroller with multiple sensors. The proposed method employs IoT and Bluetooth connectivity for data monitoring. IoT enables control of real-time data from anywhere while Bluetooth aids short-range data monitoring through an android application. To examine the efficacy of the developed model, the accuracy of waste label classification, sensors data estimation, and system usability scale (SUS) are enumerated and interpreted. The classification accuracy of the proposed architecture based on the CNN model is 95.3125%, and the SUS score is 86%. However, this smart system will be adjustable to household activities with real-time waste monitoring. © 2020 The Authors},

India is accountable for producing 12% of the global municipal waste. As a result, waste is collectively dumped irrespective of the type leading to drainage blockages, pollution and diseases. In this paper, we have proposed a model for waste segregation that uses neural networks to classify waste images into three categories namely recyclable, non-recyclable and organic. A training accuracy of 83.77% and testing accuracy of 81.25% was obtained. Along with the proposed neural network, five standard CNN architectures – VGG-16, Dense-Net, Inception-Net, Mobile-Net and Res-Net are also tested on the given dataset. The highest test accuracy of 92.65% was obtained from the Mobile-Net classifier.

abstract={Automatic Waste Segregation is the process of classifying and separating waste objects into several categories for further treatment, it acts as a middle process between cumulative collection and waste treatment. Improper waste treatment not only causes pollution but also increases the overall cost of the waste treatment process, hence a proper waste segregation mechanism needs to be implemented before treatment. The paper is a successful attempt of creating a waste segregation mechanism with minimal cost and with minimal human intervention at household level with the help of deep learning specifically Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), image recognition and Internet of Things (IoT). The model classifies a waste as either biodegradable or non-biodegradable and segregates waste into separate compartments using a flap mechanism, the proposed model also sends feedback to the user in real time as when the bin requires maintenance. The neural network is trained using a large dataset consisting of approx. 13000 images combined with suitable hidden layers, 70-30 % images were used for training and testing respectfully. The proposed model gives accuracy of 92%. The classification and segregation happens in real time which helps to reduce overall human efforts and reduces cost of overall process. © 2020 Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt. Ltd.

abstract={The presence of municipal wastewater at the intake of a major drinking water treatment facility located on Lake Ontario was examined using fluorescence data collected during a period of continuous monitoring. In addition, controlled mixing of lake water and wastewater sampled from a local treatment facility were conducted using a bench-scale fluorescence system to quantify observed changes in natural organic matter. Multivariate linear regression was applied to components derived from parallel factors analysis. The resulting mean absolute error for predicted wastewater level was 0.22% (V/V, wastewater/lake water), indicating that wastewater detection at below 1.0% (V/V) was possible. Analyses of sucralose, a wastewater indicator, were conducted for treated wastewater as well as surface water collected at two intake locations on Lake Ontario. Results suggested minimal wastewater contribution at the drinking water intake. A wastewater detection model using a moving baseline was developed and applied to continuous fluorescence data collected at one of the drinking water intakes, which agreed well with sucralose results. Furthermore, the simulated addition of 1.0% (V/V) of wastewater/wastewater was detectable in 89% of samples analyzed, demonstrating the utility of fluorescence-based wastewater monitoring. © 2019},

Methods Based on the status of urban domestic waste recycling process, process analysis and comparison method was used to analyze the related problems. According to the composition and nature of urban domestic garbage, the automatic subdivision standard suitable for intelligent classified trash cans was proposed. Result It is concluded that the traditional process has the problems of centralized treatment and vague positioning of each subject. Therefore, the keys should focus on the front-end classification to removal centralization, distinguish the positioning of each subject clearly and use technology to drive the classification. From these, the paper analyzes the composition and nature of recyclable garbage and harmful garbage to propose the automatic subdivision standard. Conclusion Only by making full use of people's subjective initiative, using intelligent classified trash cans as carriers to subdivide automatically, can improve the garbage recycling process.

abstract={Unsegregated heterogeneous mass of solid waste is a potential threat towards the safe processing and disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW), which is cumbersome and ancillary, elevates the expenditure. The absence of any pertinent technique, to handle these bulky mass in an eco-friendly way, makes it even more hectic for the MSW processing plants. But, this substantial mass constitutes a huge potential, which can be valorized through the larval digestion of a symbiotic macro culture, to create new economic niches for small-scale entrepreneurship in developing and under-developed nations. The present study incorporates a symbiotic waste reduction system with the efficient functionalism of micro and macro conversion agents which is attributed to the synthesis of waste derived co-products from the same platform. This study is solely a novel approach, which is capable of addressing a wide fraction of solid waste, domestic sewage, and bio-leachate and converts them into value-Added co-products within the magnificent period of time. Multiple experiments have been conducted under the controlled feeding environment with an established symbiosis between the BSF larvae, Wax Moth larvae (Galleria melonella), and effective microorganism culture. An initiation period of 5 days was allocated for the macro conversion agents and during the tenure, the larvae were supplied with synthetic diet to accelerate the body growth index. The entire experiments have been conducted in a newly formulated novel bioreactor namely, Integral Larval Grub Composting Reactor which is capable of performing automated pupal segregation and address solid and liquid waste under a single platform. The system enforces the zero liquid discharge concepts and also helps in an indirect suppression of house fly growth. The novel approach only required 14-16 days in order to convert the solid waste into nutrient-rich manure, having significantly high-quality component. The operation has been executed in a number of batch processes and each process valorized a quantity of approx 30 kg. The targeted larval period has been prolonged by means of maintaining higher moisture content with the help of sewage supply and once the maturation period arrives the further addition of moisture has been restricted for 3 days. Overall it's an ultimate and wholesome biological waste management technique, which is capable of standing solely to strengthen the sustainable waste management strategy. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={A crucial prerequisite for recycling forming an integral part of municipal solid waste (MSW) management is sorting of useful materials from source-separated MSW. The morphological composition of the waste generated in Russia was studied. Theoretical bases of management of the waste sorting conveyor have been developed taking into account failures such as uneven loading and uneven sorting of waste. The calculation of the waste material balance was based on solving the system of Euler equations and flow control. Control laws are defined to control the flow and density of waste on the conveyor. A relay-contact scheme for automatic sorting of waste to extract various fractions of recyclable waste, such as metal, plastic, paper, glass and organic matter from MSW was developed. The synthesis of a finite state of a machine control system for waste sorting is implemented on a programmable logic device Omron. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Increasing urbanization has led to a major waste management crisis with the proliferation of improperly planned structures having no proper facility to collect, segregate and process waste. Domestic waste has increasing chemical and plastic content. These chemicals do not perish unless treated properly. The treatment also necessitates timely collection, segregation and if possible decomposition, reuse or recycling. Human intervention has been the most popular way to segregate waste, but when it comes to working with a mixture of wastes, it puts their health and hygiene at stake. It is always better to treat waste through the help of robots which can handle waste in any hazardous environment. An automated waste collection and segregation system based on a robotic assembly and machine learning based classification is developed. A robotic arm with a distance sensor will pick up the waste and place it on a binary classifier platform which has a camera attached to capture the image and an algorithm to classify the waste as biodegradable or non-biodegradable into their respective bins. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Hyperspectral imaging technology is profoundly applied into the fields of agriculture, medicine and remote sensing due to its high spectral resolution, merged image-spectrum, and fast non-destructive testing. While the method used now has the defects of long-term testing period, poor efficiency and sorting asynchrony. Spectral image can identify and classify the target garbage by establishing a recognition and classification model and analyzing reflectance spectrum information based on the facts that different materials of domestic garbage, due to their different molecular structures, will absorb different wavelengths of light and the hyperspectral image can obtain the spatial information and the reflectance spectral information from different-wavelength illumination of the target garbage. Collected recyclable garbage samples of common paper, plastic and wood materials, including plastic bottles, food packaging bags, plastic toys (jewelry) pieces, disposable chopsticks, ice cream bars, wooden furniture pieces, wooden boxes, waste textbooks, advertising paper, office paper and other items, 30 in total. And cleaned and cut them to avoid the influence of sample surface stains on the sample reflectivity. Hyperspectral imaging systems were used to acquire hyperspectral images of the sample in the near-infrared (780 ~1 000 nm) formed 18 training samples and 12 test samples. Pre-processed the collected sample image by de-noising and black-and-white correction inversion of reflectivity information. Then analyzed the region of interest of training samples by principal components analysis. The characteristic band extracted were 795.815, 836.869, 885.619, 916.409, 929.239, 934.37, 957.463, 972.858, 988.253 nm; Next, matched and categorized the characteristic band of the ROI with reference spectra of the three types of garbage from the characteristic band by spectral angle mapping. The result illustrated that the classification precision of paper (A class), plastic (B class) and wood (C class) were 100%, 98% and 100% respectively and the average was 99.33%; at last, sorted the test samples by Fisher linear discrimination. The classification precision of class A, B, C were 100%, 100% and 97% respectively and the average was 99%. After a series of testing and classification by SAM and Fisher as the narrated above, the results showed that aforesaid manipulation of hyperspectral image for recyclable garbage by SAM can get more accurate results which is 99.33%. meanwhile, the research can testify that it's feasible to apply the scheme of hyperspectral imaging to assort garbage, which is significant to methodically and automatically recycle garbage in the future. © 2019, Peking University Press.

abstract={Economic growth and rapid urbanization have resulted in various urban problems related to sustainable development. The continuous increase in household solid waste has become a significant concern worldwide, while waste sorting has been regarded as an effective method for waste reduction. However, the low recycling rates of household solid waste are common in many countries. Accordingly, our study used theory of planned behavior (TPB) to construct a “motivation–intention–behavior” theoretical model for the systemic illustration of the antecedents of household solid waste sorting behavior. A comparative study was performed to explore the similarities and differences between the determinants of sorting behavior in Shanghai and Singapore. A survey of 1100 urban residents from these two places was conducted to validate our model by using structural equation modeling. Findings indicated that general and specific environmental motivations substantially influenced behavioral intention. Moreover, the direct influence and moderating effect of contextual factors on waste sorting behavior are significant. Habitual factors also have a significant effect on behavior. Our study enhanced the understanding of the determinants of household solid waste sorting behavior and improved TPB by simultaneously adding motivation, contextual, and habitual factors. Moreover, our study used theory of environmental interventions as basis to provide several suggestions that will improve existing policies. These suggestions can be valuable references for waste management in megacities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In order to solve the rural living garbage processing problems, we independently developed a unique technology of clean and comprehensive utilization of rural garbage resources, referred to as PGAS technology. Based on modern biodegradation and automatic sorting, we built a complete industrial chain with mixed domestic waste as mineral raw material. The garbage trucks transport rural garbage and directly discharged into the hopper. Quickly biofilm is sprayed to deodorize garbage, then the garbage bags are teared at the same time of feeding. At the transportation, we utilize magnetic and eddy current sorting to get metal products and residues, while the residue will be transferred into the tearing machine and the biological treatment silo, where the raw garbage is mixed by composite bacteria liquid and enzyme liquid. The organic pus would be pumped to anaerobic fermentation system, while the residue would be alternatively tearing through broken drum to main sorting system. By our innovated equipment, we obtain inorganic material as sand and glass, pulp and sundries like bamboo textiles, and pure plastic at last. The products would be further processing to industrial materials as required of market. The sand and gravel glass and other inorganic materials can produce hollow blocks, paving brick and sponge brick. The pulp would change to the pulp products which can be directly used for producing cardboard and corrugated paper. The plastic can be packaged directly to sale, or be used in oil refining, even can be further sorted to monomer plastic, such as PE, and to produce particles. The slurry is pumped into the biogas tank for producing the methane gas through anaerobic fermentation system, which can be reused as energy. And the slurry after anaerobic fermentation, through evaporation, can be sprayed into powder or granular fertilizer. This technology subverted the traditional mode of rural waste disposal, which is the only comprehensive utilization of rural garbage with all components. The whole processing line is close with no smelly gas. There is no sewer in the whole plant with no waste water emissions, the water is in circulation. There is no operator in the whole plant, the sorting is automatic. Take the PGAS demonstration project in Yuanqu County, Shanxi Province as an example. The project was completed in 2017 and has been put into operation for 1 year with a processing capacity of 100 t/d. The radiation area includes 2 towns and 3 townships with about 100 000 people. According to this waste plant's operation data, treating 1 ton waste by PGAS, we can obtain the average amount of 65 kg organic fertilizer, 105 kg pulp, 124 kg plastic, 133 kg waste derived fuel, 135 kg sand, 55 kg methane and 11 kg metal. The cost is about 180 yuan, and the output value is about 325 yuan. The investment cost is nearly 40% less than that of incineration. After the sewage treatment, the removal rate of various pollution factors reaches 88.76% on average, which is used for recycling. It is proved that this technology can improve the efficiency of waste disposal. This technology has considerable economic benefits, is environmentally friendly, and has high promotion value. © 2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Therefore, the main purpose of the work is to define methods for recycling waste and their environmental aspects. To achieve this goal, the methods of analysis, spectroscopy were used. It is determined that the final treatment of waste, to date, means either their disposal in a landfill or incineration, which adversely affects the environment. Methods for identifying the material of the object, as well as algorithms for the selection and recognition of objects by processing data from the computer vision system are considered.

However, in reality, the process of collection and disposal of most medical waste does not strictly follow the corresponding standards, thus resulting in great potential risks to people's health. Our research analyzed existing problems with medical waste classification management, optimized the medical waste recycling business model, and then used the simulation software AnyLogic to design mixed and classification simulation models based on current literature regarding the standards of medical waste classification and composition in China. Furthermore, we simulated and calculated the generation of nonrecyclable medical waste, recyclable medical waste, and domestic waste in the three models based on 30,000 tons of medical waste generated in Beijing in 2015. We compared and analyzed the output, generation rate, disposal cost, recycling revenue, and cost-benefit based on the disposal cost standards of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Development and Reform and the China Renewable Resources Price Index in Beijing. The importance of strengthening the classification and recycling of medical waste was further validated by modeling and simulation.

This paper reviews the development of China's municipal solid waste classification, collects the endeavours done by national and local authorities in the promotion, and extracts obstacles and bottlenecks during the process and countermeasures. This paper concludes that China's municipal solid waste classification has undergone three stages identified as begining (1990s), pilot exploration (2000~2015) and rapid development (2016 to now). At present, a highly operative waste classification method, propaganda way fused with Internet+, practical regulations and a progressively improved circulation chain (classified collection - classified transportation - classified treatment) are gradually adopted by national and local authorities to promote municipal solid waste classification. Even the classification of municipal solid waste is gradually progressing towards marketization. China will embark on a feasible, reproducible and promotional model of municipal solid waste classification. In the future, it is of great significance to rapidly promote the municipal solid waste classification in China by strengthening public participation and responsibility to recover, introducing more specific and highly operative implementation plans, emphasizing the classification education of school children, and making full use of domestic scavengers. © 2018, Editorial Board of China Environmental Science.

abstract={With the accelerating pace of urbanization, the continuous increase of municipal solid waste (MSW) has become a major obstacle to China's economic development. Therefore, China recently regards MSW classification scenario as an important strategy for national ecological civilization. However, published references have not focused on MSW classification in view of environmental, economic and social acceptation simultaneously. This research proposes a new Decision Support System (DSS) model considering all three aspects to analyze the comprehensive benefit of the four MSW classification scenarios in Pudong (Shanghai, China) using cost benefit analysis (CBA), life cycle assessment (LCA) and analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Among them, there is an important boundary factor in the life cycle assessment. This work mainly focuses on the net energy consumption, namely the air and water emission of different substances. The results show that the classification scenario II, dividing MSW into toxic and hazardous waste, recyclable, kitchen waste and combustible waste, is the best option. Although scenario III (MSW is divided into toxic and hazardous waste, recyclable waste (paper, plastic, scrap metal, waste glass and other small class), kitchen waste and combustible wastes) and IV (recyclable waste in Scenario II is further classified, for example, paper is subdivided into newspapers, books, cardboard, etc.) further refine the MSW classification, the DSS model analysis results indicate that neither of these are the most feasible scenario. Therefore, finer classification is not always the better if we consider all three pillars of sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={When dealing with practical applications of hyperspectral imaging, the development of efficient, fast and flexible classification algorithms is of the utmost importance. Indeed, the optimal classification method should be able, in a reasonable time, to maximise the separation between the classes of interest and, at the same time, to correctly reject possible outlier samples. To this aim, a new extension of Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), namely Soft PLS-DA, has been implemented. The basic engine of Soft PLS-DA is the same as PLS-DA, but class assignment is subjected to some additional criteria which allow samples not belonging to the target classes to be identified and rejected. The proposed approach was tested on a real case study of plastic waste sorting based on near infrared hyperspectral imaging. Household plastic waste objects made of the six recyclable plastic polymers commonly used for packaging were collected and imaged using a hyperspectral camera mounted on an industrial sorting system. In addition, paper and not recyclable plastics were also considered as potential foreign materials that are commonly found in plastic waste. For classification purposes, the Soft PLS-DA algorithm was integrated into a hierarchical classification tree for the discrimination of the different plastic polymers. Furthermore, Soft PLS-DA was also coupled with sparse-based variable selection to identify the relevant variables involved in the classification and to speed up the sorting process. The tree-structured classification model was successfully validated both on a test set of representative spectra of each material for a quantitative evaluation, and at the pixel level on a set of hyperspectral images for a qualitative assessment. © 2018 The Authors.},

abstract={Remote sensing of the Earth allows to receive information of medium, a high spatial resolution from space vehicles and to conduct hyperspectral measurements. In many cases, waste disposal sites (WDS) is not legal. So, it is very important to use the system for automatic detection such places using satellite images. In this paper, a model of the automated space monitoring system for the presence of waste disposal sites is developed. The proposed system includes the following blocks: A database of WDS; a subsystem for detecting unauthorized WDS; a subsystem for monitoring the design, operation and reclamation rules for existing WDS; a subsystem for estimating the parameters of the WDS and their impact on the environment; a subsystem of satellite monitoring. We propose a method of detecting high-rise buildings landfills, such as municipal dumps and solid waste, according to a radar image (the height of the ground level). For system design, we use the apparatus of discrete orthogonal transformations. The impact of the WDS influence on agricultural crops is analyzed, based on the data of the Earth remote space sensing based on the orthogonal transform. The purpose of the work is the modeling of an automated space monitoring system for the presence of waste disposal facilities using regularization method in the problem of filtering of space images from the noise stored in the archives. As a result, the proposed method demonstrates good accuracy in detection the solid waste disposal site on real satellite images. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

abstract={Though Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is a worldwide problem, the collected wastes are dumped in open dumping at landfilling sites while the uncollected wastes remain strewn on the roadside, many-a-time clogging drainage. Such unsafe and inadequate management of MSW causes spread of bacteria, viruses, particulate matter, dioxins and other harmful pollutants in the surroundings and atmosphere. Hence, due to the repeated exposure of population to these pollutants can lead to serious health problems such as Diarrhea/Dysentery, Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI), and Asthma/Chronic Respiratory Diseases (CRD). Therefore, two-phase study included secondary data on diseases caused due to environmental pollution and primary data on MSW and lack of MSW management from 127 households in urban Patna, India. The random sampling method was used for collection of primary survey data, conducted during 2015-16 in selected areas of Patna. Logistic regression model odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were used to show the strength of the associations among segregation of wastes at source, segregation behavior, collection bins in the area, distance of collection bins from a residential area, and transportation of MSW. The ROC is a statistical technique to validate the logistic regression method that predicts the occurrence of an event through the comparison of probability picture of an event occurrence observed by probability and the predicted probability of the same event. The area under the ROC curve is up to 0.889 extent, which reveals that the 'segregation of waste at source' has a very strong scope to accomplish sustainable recycling at urban Patna in order to manage waste with the overall accuracy of 92.126%, which proves a better fit logistic regression model. Hence, this paper concludes that 'segregation of waste at source' helps to attain sustainable recycling which would be the most viable approach to manage MSW in Patna and would eventually reduce environmental pollutants for the public health safety. © Copyright by Polish Academy of Sciences},

abstract={There has been a significant rise in municipal solid waste (MSW) generation in the last few decades due to rapid urbanization and industrialization. Due to the lack of source segregation practice, a need for automated segregation of recyclables from MSW exists in the developing countries. This paper reports a thermal imaging based system for classifying useful recyclables from simulated MSW sample. Experimental results have demonstrated the possibility to use thermal imaging technique for classification and a robotic system for sorting of recyclables in a single process step. The reported classification system yields an accuracy in the range of 85–96% and is comparable with the existing single-material recyclable classification techniques. We believe that the reported thermal imaging based system can emerge as a viable and inexpensive large-scale classification-cum-sorting technology in recycling plants for processing MSW in developing countries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Pro-environmental activities, such as waste sorting, are considered inconveniencing; the higher the inconvenience, the more difficult it becomes to encourage active public participation. This study defines waste sorting behavior considering certain attributes and estimates the inconvenience costs associated with each attribute. The definition also considers how and when waste is disposed of as well as the hygiene of a disposal spot. We apply a conjoint analysis for data collection and latent class logit model to calculate the inconvenience costs. The model incorporates consumers' heterogeneity as a finite number of homogenous groups. The results show that the inconvenience cost for the hygiene of the disposal spot is generally higher than that of sorting itself; this tendency is strongest among young women. Moreover, older people report lower inconvenience costs than do younger ones. Further, some groups prefer manual sorting to an automated sorting service for food waste. Our findings offer policy implications considering such inconvenience costs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The heating values, particularly lower heating values of burning municipal solid waste are critically important parameters in operating circulating fluidized bed incineration systems. However, the heating values change widely and frequently, while there is no reliable real-time instrument to measure heating values in the process of incinerating municipal solid waste. A rapid, cost-effective, and comparative methodology was proposed to evaluate the heating values of burning MSW online based on prior knowledge, expert experience, and data-mining techniques. First, selecting the input variables of the model by analyzing the operational mechanism of circulating fluidized bed incinerators, and the corresponding heating value was classified into one of nine fuzzy expressions according to expert advice. Development of prediction models by employing four different nonlinear models was undertaken, including a multilayer perceptron neural network, a support vector machine, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, and a random forest; a series of optimization schemes were implemented simultaneously in order to improve the performance of each model. Finally, a comprehensive comparison study was carried out to evaluate the performance of the models. Results indicate that the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system model outperforms the other three models, with the random forest model performing second-best, and the multilayer perceptron model performing at the worst level. A model with sufficient accuracy would contribute adequately to the control of circulating fluidized bed incinerator operation and provide reliable heating value signals for an automatic combustion control system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In the U.K., between 7.6 m3 to 76m3 of water is lost annually in each residence through leaks. In contrast to the ongoing improvement on water distribution network leakage detection technologies, research on water leakage at the domestic level has been limited. Identification of large flow rate leaks (i.e. L/min. with floods or bursts) through the analysis of the household water consumption is highly feasible. However, micro-flow rate leaks (i.e. mL/min.) tend to be overlooked and can therefore waste hundreds of liters of water before detection. This, alongside increasing awareness of water quality and resource protection, mandates further investigation of micro-leak detection systems. An innovative micro-leak detection system for domestic applications that utilizes an ultrasonic flowmeter in a new shunt configuration is proposed. Unlike conventional water leakage detection systems, the proposed automated system is highly sensitive (detected leaks of 1 mL/min.) and does not impede the main flow. The micro-leak detection system is completely automated as it employs a: USB-powered voltmeter, USB-powered flowmeter and USB-powered switches. An elegant feature is that the system is remotely controlled across the Globe; thus, allowing large-scale data collection and system control. This system circumvents water leaks on any scale, anywhere in the world. This latter feature is beyond the reach of the complex conventional detection methods. The de-noising property of Wavelet transform is carried out on the remotely collected data from the ultrasonic flowmeter to remove unwanted noise. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Recycling of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) is important, not only to reduce the amount of waste requiring treatment, but also to promote the recovery of valuable materials as well as the responsible elimination of its hazardous components and compounds. One of key issues in plastic recycling is identification of plastics containing brominated flame retardants (BFRs), which should not enter recycling products. There are technologies that can identify the plastics with BFRs, however, none of this is practiced for WEEE or e-waste. In the present study, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) technique is used to identify and sort the plastics with BFRs recovered from the used small household appliances such as an electric cooker, a vacuum cleaner, an air cleaner, etc. LIBS is a form of atomic emission spectroscopy which is typically performed using a pulsed laser to create a surface ablation on a sample which is then analyzed spectroscopically for its elemental and molecular composition. LIBS also has its own set of advantages such as it is able to detect black plastics. The present communication gives a brief review of the current status of the development on lab-scale automatic sensing system for identification and sorting of plastics obtained from the used small household appliances. © The Mining and Materials Processing Institute of Japan},

The plastic concentration in used small HH is particularly high compared to that of large HH. A great variety of plastics is used in small HH, and such differ not only by plastic type but also by color and presence of additives. Different separation technologies, such as optical sorting, gravity and electrostatic separation, and flotation, are widely used for recovering plastics from municipal wastes, e-scraps, and so on. Near-infrared ray (NIR) sensors are particularly used for separating plastics by resin type at high throughputs. However, one of the shortcomings of NIR sensors is its inability to detect black plastics. This study developed an automatic sorting system based on a new sensing system to classify black plastics obtained from used small HH. To reduce data dimensions, spectrum data were preprocessed by adopting principal component analysis and by treating with a classifier, which was designed with artificial intelligence algorithm. Results of the lab-scale automatic sorting system for sorting black plastics by type are discussed. ©The Mining and Materials Processing Institute of Japan},

abstract={Anthropogenic material stocks are expanding at ever-increasing rates across the world, and their environmental and economic impacts draw more and more attention from academia, policy makers, and economic and environmental bodies. As the knowledge base regarding anthropogenic material stocks expands, it is important to not only comprehend the societal side of material stock growth but also its counterpart to the material balance—the natural environment from which the materials used for stocks come from. However, due to difficulties of data procurement, and muted interest in materials which are considered low-value high volume, the environmental burdens related to construction minerals have received less attention so far despite the huge amounts involved. In this study, we employ geographic information systems (GIS) with digital elevation model (DEM) datasets, to form an automated method of detection and measurement of the anthropogenic disturbance of soil and earth at excavation and mining sites, which accounts not only for the material extracted for usage in the anthroposphere, but also its related unused extraction. This geographically explicit method allows to directly pinpoint the location and volume of anthropogenic disturbance. Using Japan as a case study, the results suggest that the ratio of unused extraction to used extraction may exceed 1:1 for construction minerals in Japan. We also find that the environmental effects of anthropogenic activity are bigger than natural soil disturbance by several orders of magnitude, highlighting the need to reduce raw material extraction and increase the efficient use of the existing material stock. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

However, the integrity of material flow analysis results is compromised by data uncertainties, an occurrence that is particularly acute in low-and-middle-income study contexts. This article investigates the uncertainties in the input data and their effects in a material flow analysis study of municipal solid waste management in Maputo City, the capital of Mozambique. The analysis is based on data collected in 2007 and 2014. Initially, the uncertainties and their ranges were identified by the data classification model of Hedbrant and Sörme, followed by the application of sensitivity analysis. The average lower and upper bounds were 29% and 71%, respectively, in 2007, increasing to 41% and 96%, respectively, in 2014. This indicates higher data quality in 2007 than in 2014. Results also show that not only data are partially missing from the established flows such as waste generation to final disposal, but also that they are limited and inconsistent in emerging flows and processes such as waste generation to material recovery (hence the wider variation in the 2014 parameters). The sensitivity analysis further clarified the most influencing parameter and the degree of influence of each parameter on the waste flows and the interrelations among the parameters. The findings highlight the need for an integrated municipal solid waste management approach to avoid transferring or worsening the negative impacts among the parameters and flows. © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={In this study, we investigate the usability of sound recognition for source separation of packaging wastes in reverse vending machines (RVMs). For this purpose, an experimental setup equipped with a sound recording mechanism was prepared. Packaging waste sounds generated by three physical impacts such as free falling, pneumatic hitting and hydraulic crushing were separately recorded using two different microphones. To classify the waste types and sizes based on sound features of the wastes, a support vector machine (SVM) and a hidden Markov model (HMM) based sound classification systems were developed. In the basic experimental setup in which only free falling impact type was considered, SVM and HMM systems provided 100% classification accuracy for both microphones. In the expanded experimental setup which includes all three impact types, material type classification accuracies were 96.5% for dynamic microphone and 97.7% for condenser microphone. When both the material type and the size of the wastes were classified, the accuracy was 88.6% for the microphones. The modeling studies indicated that hydraulic crushing impact type recordings were very noisy for an effective sound recognition application. In the detailed analysis of the recognition errors, it was observed that most of the errors occurred in the hitting impact type. According to the experimental results, it can be said that the proposed novel approach for the separation of packaging wastes could provide a high classification performance for RVMs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Hospitals and health centers provide a variety of healthcare services and normally generate hazardous waste as well as general waste. General waste has a similar nature to that of municipal solid waste and therefore could be disposed of in municipal landfills. However, hazardous waste poses risks to public health, unless it is properly managed. The hospital waste management system encompasses many factors, i.e., number of beds, number of employees, level of service, population, birth rate, fertility rate, and not in my back yard (NIMBY) syndrome. Therefore, this management system requires a comprehensive analysis to determine the role of each factor and its influence on the whole system. In this research, a hospital waste management simulation model is presented based on the system dynamics technique to determine the interaction among these factors in the system using a software package, ithink. This model is used to estimate waste segregation as this is important in the hospital waste management system to minimize risk to public health. Real data has been obtained from a case study of the city of Nablus, Palestine to validate the model. The model exhibits wastes generated from three types of hospitals (private, charitable, and government) by considering the number of both inpatients and outpatients depending on the population of the city under study. The model also offers the facility to compare the total waste generated among these different types of hospitals and anticipate and predict the future generated waste both infectious and non-infectious and the treatment cost incurred. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={The relevance of the research is caused by simplification of receiving and processing satellite images through automation of processing and calculation of various indices of underlying surface, and their temporal changes. The proposed method allows detecting, with high speed and on a large scale, the signs of soil degradation, in particular, the waste disposal facilities of the size, multiple of images spatial resolution, calculating proper surface indices. The main drawback of the existing methods of detecting waste disposal sites is that their search, detection, environmental assessment are carried out by ground, "manual" methods, which gives low productivity and research in this area, first of all, their revealing. As a result of introduction of the automation detection method of waste disposal facilities the security of territory, affected by negative factors, expressed on the surface of the earth by various surface indices, and particularly by factor of littering the environment, can be improved significantly. The main aim of the study is to develop a method for obtaining automatically the underlying surface indices and time series using satellite images linked to UTM geographical projection and their metadata. The methods used in the study: methods of getting cloud masks (threshold filtering method) and regression analysis (method of standard deviation) for temporal processing. The results. The paper introduces the algorithm of automatic data processing and describes the main steps of its operation. The authors define the model of conversion parameters of underlying surface indices change when adding new values of the spectral brightness coefficients or deleting the previous ones. The algorithm operation is shown by the example of calculation of NDVI time-series of the given observation area and their application to analyze the processing data, in particular, the NDVI images are automatically calculated in neighborhood landfill of Torbeevo Lyubertsky district for 2003-2011. The paper illustrates structural changes in soil bio-productivity within four municipal landfills of Zheleznodorozhny urban district in Moscow region: Kuchino, Savvino, Licyi Gory, Nekrasovka.},

abstract={Municipal solid waste (MSW), generated at an unprecedented rate due to rapid urbanization and industrialization contains useful recyclable materials like metals, plastic, wood, etc. Recycling of useful materials from MSW in the developing countries is severely constrained by limited door-to-door collection and poor means of segregation. Recovery of recyclables is usually performed by waste pickers, which is highly risky and hazardous for their health. This paper reports the development of a robotic mobile manipulation system for automated sorting of useful recyclables from MSW. The developed robot is equipped with a thermal imaging camera, proximity sensor and a 5-DOF robotic arm. This paper presents an approach for sorting based on automated identification from thermographic images. The developed algorithm extracts keypoint features from the thermographic image and feeds into clustering model to map them into a bag-of-word vectors. Finally, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used for identifying the recyclable material. We used the developed algorithm to detect three categories of recyclables namely, aluminum can, plastic bottle and tetra pack from given thermographic images. We obtained classification rate of 94.3% in the tests. In future, we plan to extend the developed approach for classifying a wider range of recyclable objects as well as to incorporate motion planning algorithms to handle cluttered environments.
